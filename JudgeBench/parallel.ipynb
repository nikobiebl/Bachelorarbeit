      "As a Domain-Expert-Agent I think both responses attempt to provide a reasoned guess based on the context of political corruption in India. However, Response A leans towards a higher estimate of 86%, which, while plausible given the historical context of corruption perceptions, lacks specific data to support it. Response B, on the other hand, provides a more nuanced approach by eliminating the lower percentages and suggesting a more moderate estimate of 66%. This aligns better with various surveys and studies conducted around that time, which often indicated that while corruption was perceived as a significant issue, it was not universally viewed as being as high as 86% or 90%.\n",
      "\n",
      "In practical scenarios, especially when discussing public perception, it's important to consider the range of opinions and the context in which these perceptions are formed. Response B's choice of 66% reflects a more balanced understanding of the situation, making it a more factually correct answer based on the general trends observed in public opinion data from that period.\n",
