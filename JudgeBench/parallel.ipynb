The question asks about data from 2013, so we need to focus on information from that specific year.\\n\\n2. The question is about the perception of corruption in political parties in India.\\n\\n3. Unfortunately, I don\\'t have access to precise data for this specific question from 2013.\\n\\n4. However, based on general knowledge about corruption perceptions in India, we can make an educated guess.\\n\\n5. India has historically had high perceived levels of corruption in politics.\\n\\n6. The options given range from 10% to 90%.\\n\\n7. Given the reputation of political corruption in India, it\\'s likely to be on the higher end of this range.\\n\\n8. Among the higher options, 86% (option A) seems plausible.\\n\\n9.

The question asks about data from 2013 regarding corruption perception of political parties in India.\\n\\n2. We don\\'t have the exact data point provided in the question, so we\\'ll need to make an educated guess based on general knowledge and the options provided.\\n\\n3. Corruption in political parties is often perceived to be high in many countries, especially in developing nations like India.\\n\\n4. Looking at the options, we can eliminate some of the lower percentages like 10%, 26%, and 30% as they seem too low for such a perception.\\n\\n5. Similarly, 90% seems a bit too high, even for a pessimistic view.\\n\\n6. The remaining options are 46%, 50%, 66%, 70%, 76%, and 86%.\\n\\n7. Among these, 66%, 70%, and 76% seem more plausible, as they indicate a significant majority but not an overwhelming one.\\n\\n8. Of these three, 66% is often cited in various contexts as a \"two-thirds majority,\" which makes it stand out as a reasonable guess.\\n\\nTherefore, my best guess would be option (D) 66%.\\n\\nAs requested, I\\'ll duplicate this letter five times:\\n\\nDDDDD\\n    ', 'role': 'assistant', 'name': 'initializer'}, {'content': 'As a Domain-Expert-Agent I think Response A provides a more accurate reflection of the general sentiment regarding political corruption in India as of 2013.

      "3) It's also not about portfolio diversification limits, so we can eliminate C.\n",

      "   - Hyperpolarization: When the membrane potential becomes more negative.\n",
      "   - Action potential: A rapid rise and fall in membrane potential.\n",
      "   - Equilibrium potential: The membrane potential at which there's no net flow of a particular ion.\n",
      "   - Resting potential: The steady-state membrane potential when a neuron is not transmitting a signal.\n",
      "   - Graded potential: A small change in membrane potential that doesn't reach the threshold.\n",
      "   - Depolarization: When the membrane potential becomes less negative (or more positive).\n",
      "   - Synapse potential: The change in membrane potential at a synapse.\n",
      "   - Refractory period: A brief period after an action potential during which another action potential can't occur.\n",
      "   - Repolarization: The return of the membrane potential to its resting state after depolarization.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) The question describes a change from +50 mV to -70 mV.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) This is a change from a more positive to a more negative potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) When a membrane potential becomes more negative, this is called hyperpolarization.\n",

      "3. The normal resting potential of a neuron is usually around -70 mV.\n",

The explanation correctly outlines the definitions of relevant terms and logically concludes that moving from a positive to a more negative potential is indeed hyperpolarization. \\n\\nIn contrast, Response B incorrectly categorizes the change as repolarization. While it correctly describes the transition from a depolarized state back to a more negative state, it fails to recognize that the final state of -70 mV is not merely a return to resting potential but rather a hyperpolarized state, especially since the resting potential is typically around -70 mV. \\n\\nIn practical scenarios, understanding these distinctions is crucial for interpreting neuronal behavior, especially in the context of action potentials and synaptic transmission. Therefore, Response A is more factually correct in this context.\\n\\n{\"response\": A}', cost={'usage_including_cached_inference': {'total_cost': 0.004090049999999999, 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18': {'cost': 0.004090049999999999, 'prompt_tokens': 13975, 'completion_tokens': 3323, 'total_tokens': 17298}}, 'usage_excluding_cached_inference': {'total_cost': 0.004090049999999999, 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18': {'cost': 0.004090049999999999, 'prompt_tokens': 13975, 'completion_tokens': 3323, 'total_tokens': 17298}}}, human_input=[])\n",
