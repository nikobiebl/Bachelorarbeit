      "    Article: Boss Nigel Pearson has urged Leicester to keep their cool and ignore their relegation rivals. The Foxes host Swansea on Saturday just three points from safety in the Barclays Premier League after back-to-back wins. Last week's 3-2 win at West Brom handed them a survival lifeline, although they remain bottom of the table. Jamie Vardy scored an injury-time winner against West Bromwich Albion on Saturday to improve his side's slim chance of Premier League survival Vardy celebrates in front of the travelling away fans after hitting the winner against West Brom But after their mini-revival, Pearson wants his side to remain focused on their own jobs. 'I'm very wary of people flipping the emphasis,' he said. 'Our future is in our own hands and if we go into the last game with that we have given ourselves a realistic chance. 'We need to make sure our own run-in is what we want it to be. Leicester manager Nigel Pearson has urged his players to focus on their own job and not worry about their relegation rivals during run-in 'It's helpful that other teams are being dragged into it. People are continually adjusting the form table and their predictions. 'We can't get involved in anything apart from being involved in our own games that may change people's perceptions. 'It's great when results go your way but they only help if you've done your own job. 'It's important for us to be in touch. One of the potential problems we have to deal with is people are now overly optimistic.'\n",

      "As an objective evaluator, I think the summary provided is severely lacking in several key areas. \n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, in terms of **relevance**, the summary fails to capture the essential context of Leicester's situation in the Premier League, particularly the significance of their recent back-to-back wins and their current position just three points from safety. The mention of Swansea hosting Swansea is a glaring error, as it should state that Leicester is hosting Swansea. This misrepresentation of teams is a critical oversight that undermines the summary's accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of **consistency**, the summary inaccurately states that West Brom is bottom of the table without clarifying that Leicester is currently in that position, which is misleading. The summary also omits important quotes from Pearson that emphasize the need for focus and the importance of their own performance, which are central to understanding the manager's message.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding **fluency**, the sentences are choppy and lack smooth transitions, making it difficult to read. The summary reads more like a collection of disjointed facts rather than a cohesive narrative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the **coherence** of the summary is poor. The ideas presented do not flow logically, and the lack of connection between sentences makes it hard to grasp the overall message of the article.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the summary is inadequate and fails to effectively convey the key points of the article. I would rate it poorly across all categories.\n",

However, it misses the broader context of Leicester's precarious position in the league and the significance of their recent wins, which are crucial for understanding the urgency of their situation. The mention of Swansea hosting Swansea is a significant error that detracts from the summary's relevance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding **consistency**, while the summary does mention that West Brom is bottom of the table, it fails to clarify that Leicester is currently in that position, which could mislead readers.

      "    Article: Carlos Tevez has been told to terminate his contract with Juventus to complete a return to his former club Boca Juniors in Argentina. The former Manchester City striker's deal with the Serie A champions does not expire until the end of next season but he has reportedly told the club he wishes to leave this summer. Boca have confirmed they are close to completing a deal for the 31-year-old, but club president Daniel Angelici has stressed that Tevez must terminate his contract with the Italians first. Carlos Tevez has shocked Juventus by suggesting he wants to leave the club this summer Tevez is on course to win a second Serie A title with the Old Lady and still has a shot at European glory 'We must be careful', Angelici told TYC Sports. 'We know that he wants to return to Argentina with Boca Juniors but he must first terminate his contract with Juventus, which runs until 2016. 'We are close to sealing his return and it will be done shortly.' The Argentina international joined Boca's youth academy in 1996 and went on to score 26 league goals in 76 appearances for the club before joining Corinthians in 2005. Although Juventus are reluctant to lose the league's top scorer - Tevez has netted 17 times this season - they have accepted the player wants to leave and have already started identifying potential replacements. Italian paper Tuttosport claims the 31-year-old has already decided to leave the club this summer Tevez has always said he intends to finish his career back at his first club Boca Juniors in Argentina Carlos Tevez                             17 Mauro Icardi                              16 Jeremy Menez                          16 Tevez's international manager Tata Martino claims any potential move would have no bearing on the player's Argentina future. 'The most important thing for me is that Tevez continues to play as well as he is at the moment,' Martino told Italian paper Tuttosport. 'It doesn't matter whether that's at Juventus or Boca. Only he'll know what's best for his future. 'I will say this, though: Juventus are a great team, but so are Boca Juniors. It wouldn't be a step down.'\n",

Heritage Auctions offered the gray jacket and skirt, featuring a black zigzag applique, plus more than 150 other items from the Academy Award-winning film at auction on Saturday in Beverly Hills, California. The dress - a jacket and full skirt ensemble - was worn in several key scenes in the 1939 movie, including when Scarlett O'Hara encounters Rhett Butler, played by Clark Gable, and when she gets attacked in the shanty town. Scroll down for video An outfit worn in several scenes of the 1939 film Gone With The Wind by Vivien Leigh as she played Scarlett O'Hara sold for $137,000 at auction on Saturday The dress - a jacket and full skirt ensemble - was worn in several key scenes in the 1939 movie but has suffered a little with age and has faded to light gray from original slate blue-gray color The outfit has suffered a little with age, however. When Leigh wore it in the movie, it was slate blue-gray but over the years it has faded to light gray. It was one of more than 150 items that were part of the private collection of James Tumblin, formerly in charge of the hair and makeup department at Universal Studios. Tumblin began collecting onscreen costumes, props and behind-the-scenes artifacts from the film in the 1960s, amassing a collection of more than 300,000 pieces of memorabilia. During a visit to the Western Costume Company he spotted the Scarlett O'Hara dress on the floor. He learned that the dress was about to be thrown away and negotiated a deal to buy it for $20. Tumblin has 'devoted his life and efforts to promoting Hollywood and this film, touring his items throughout the United States,' said Kathleen Guzman, managing director of Heritage Auctions. Gone With The Wind, which celebrated its 75th anniversary last year, was based on Margaret Mitchell's 1936 best-selling book about a spoiled Old South socialite, played by Vivien Leigh, and co-starred Clark gable as Rhett Butler Hattie McDaniel (left), Olivia DeHavilland (middle), and Vivien Leigh: McDaniel famously became the first African-American actor to be nominated for and win an Academy Award Other top selling items from the auction were a straw hat worn by Leigh that sold for $52,500; the trousers and jacket from a suit worn by Clark Gable as Rhett Butler, selling for $55,000; and a black bonnet worn by both Leigh and Olivia De Havilland as Melanie Wilkes, which fetched $30,000. Gone With The Wind, which celebrated its 75th anniversary last year, was based on Margaret Mitchell's 1936 best-selling book about a spoiled Old South socialite. Actress Hattie McDaniel, who played Scarlett's devoted nanny Mammy, a slave, famously became the first African-American actor to be nominated for and win an Academy Award.\n",
