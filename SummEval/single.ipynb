      "    Article: Boss Nigel Pearson has urged Leicester to keep their cool and ignore their relegation rivals. The Foxes host Swansea on Saturday just three points from safety in the Barclays Premier League after back-to-back wins. Last week's 3-2 win at West Brom handed them a survival lifeline, although they remain bottom of the table. Jamie Vardy scored an injury-time winner against West Bromwich Albion on Saturday to improve his side's slim chance of Premier League survival Vardy celebrates in front of the travelling away fans after hitting the winner against West Brom But after their mini-revival, Pearson wants his side to remain focused on their own jobs. 'I'm very wary of people flipping the emphasis,' he said. 'Our future is in our own hands and if we go into the last game with that we have given ourselves a realistic chance. 'We need to make sure our own run-in is what we want it to be. Leicester manager Nigel Pearson has urged his players to focus on their own job and not worry about their relegation rivals during run-in 'It's helpful that other teams are being dragged into it. People are continually adjusting the form table and their predictions. 'We can't get involved in anything apart from being involved in our own games that may change people's perceptions. 'It's great when results go your way but they only help if you've done your own job. 'It's important for us to be in touch. One of the potential problems we have to deal with is people are now overly optimistic.'\n",

      "    Article: Carlos Tevez has been told to terminate his contract with Juventus to complete a return to his former club Boca Juniors in Argentina. The former Manchester City striker's deal with the Serie A champions does not expire until the end of next season but he has reportedly told the club he wishes to leave this summer. Boca have confirmed they are close to completing a deal for the 31-year-old, but club president Daniel Angelici has stressed that Tevez must terminate his contract with the Italians first. Carlos Tevez has shocked Juventus by suggesting he wants to leave the club this summer Tevez is on course to win a second Serie A title with the Old Lady and still has a shot at European glory 'We must be careful', Angelici told TYC Sports. 'We know that he wants to return to Argentina with Boca Juniors but he must first terminate his contract with Juventus, which runs until 2016. 'We are close to sealing his return and it will be done shortly.' The Argentina international joined Boca's youth academy in 1996 and went on to score 26 league goals in 76 appearances for the club before joining Corinthians in 2005. Although Juventus are reluctant to lose the league's top scorer - Tevez has netted 17 times this season - they have accepted the player wants to leave and have already started identifying potential replacements. Italian paper Tuttosport claims the 31-year-old has already decided to leave the club this summer Tevez has always said he intends to finish his career back at his first club Boca Juniors in Argentina Carlos Tevez                             17 Mauro Icardi                              16 Jeremy Menez                          16 Tevez's international manager Tata Martino claims any potential move would have no bearing on the player's Argentina future. 'The most important thing for me is that Tevez continues to play as well as he is at the moment,' Martino told Italian paper Tuttosport. 'It doesn't matter whether that's at Juventus or Boca. Only he'll know what's best for his future. 'I will say this, though: Juventus are a great team, but so are Boca Juniors. It wouldn't be a step down.'\n",

      "    Article: A dress worn by Vivien Leigh when she played Scarlett O'Hara in the classic 1939 film Gone With the Wind has fetched $137,000 at auction. Heritage Auctions offered the gray jacket and skirt, featuring a black zigzag applique, plus more than 150 other items from the Academy Award-winning film at auction on Saturday in Beverly Hills, California. The dress - a jacket and full skirt ensemble - was worn in several key scenes in the 1939 movie, including when Scarlett O'Hara encounters Rhett Butler, played by Clark Gable, and when she gets attacked in the shanty town. Scroll down for video An outfit worn in several scenes of the 1939 film Gone With The Wind by Vivien Leigh as she played Scarlett O'Hara sold for $137,000 at auction on Saturday The dress - a jacket and full skirt ensemble - was worn in several key scenes in the 1939 movie but has suffered a little with age and has faded to light gray from original slate blue-gray color The outfit has suffered a little with age, however. When Leigh wore it in the movie, it was slate blue-gray but over the years it has faded to light gray. It was one of more than 150 items that were part of the private collection of James Tumblin, formerly in charge of the hair and makeup department at Universal Studios. Tumblin began collecting onscreen costumes, props and behind-the-scenes artifacts from the film in the 1960s, amassing a collection of more than 300,000 pieces of memorabilia. During a visit to the Western Costume Company he spotted the Scarlett O'Hara dress on the floor. He learned that the dress was about to be thrown away and negotiated a deal to buy it for $20. Tumblin has 'devoted his life and efforts to promoting Hollywood and this film, touring his items throughout the United States,' said Kathleen Guzman, managing director of Heritage Auctions. Gone With The Wind, which celebrated its 75th anniversary last year, was based on Margaret Mitchell's 1936 best-selling book about a spoiled Old South socialite, played by Vivien Leigh, and co-starred Clark gable as Rhett Butler Hattie McDaniel (left), Olivia DeHavilland (middle), and Vivien Leigh: McDaniel famously became the first African-American actor to be nominated for and win an Academy Award Other top selling items from the auction were a straw hat worn by Leigh that sold for $52,500; the trousers and jacket from a suit worn by Clark Gable as Rhett Butler, selling for $55,000; and a black bonnet worn by both Leigh and Olivia De Havilland as Melanie Wilkes, which fetched $30,000. Gone With The Wind, which celebrated its 75th anniversary last year, was based on Margaret Mitchell's 1936 best-selling book about a spoiled Old South socialite. Actress Hattie McDaniel, who played Scarlett's devoted nanny Mammy, a slave, famously became the first African-American actor to be nominated for and win an Academy Award.\n",

      "    Article: (CNN)SpaceX on Tuesday launched a two-stage Falcon 9 rocket carrying an uncrewed cargo spacecraft called Dragon on a flight from Cape Canaveral, Florida, to the International Space Station. That was the easy part. In a difficult bid to land a rocket stage on a floating barge for the first time, the private space exploration company  was unsuccessful. SpaceX founder Elon Musk tweeted: \"Ascent successful. Dragon enroute to Space Station. Rocket landed on droneship, but too hard for survival.\" He later clarified that the rocket landed, but tipped over. SpaceX tried to land a Falcon 9 on the drone ship in January, but the rocket hit at an angle and exploded. SpaceX has said it will keep trying and, after it masters landing at sea, hopes to someday land rockets on the ground. Usually booster rockets burn up in Earth's atmosphere or, like NASA's space shuttle boosters, they fall back into the ocean. So why try to land one? Musk wants to cut costs. On his company's website, he says that if anyone can figure out how to \"reuse rockets just like airplanes, the cost of access to space will be reduced by as much as a factor of a hundred.\" What about the rest of the rocket and the Dragon? The smaller, top part of the rocket will carry the Dragon into orbit and then break away from the cargo ship and burn up in Earth's atmosphere. The Dragon will dock with the space station a couple of days after launch to deliver more than 4,300 pounds (1,950 kilograms) of supplies, including research equipment and ISSpresso, an espresso maker that astronauts can use to make coffee and tea. The space station crew will spend about five weeks unpacking the Dragon. They'll then stuff it with over 3,000 pounds of science experiments, trash and other stuff to send back to Earth. When they're done, Dragon will leave the space station and mission controllers will guide it to splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off California. This is the sixth SpaceX mission to the International Space Station. The company was the first private space contractor to dock with the station. Tuesday's launch was the second attempt for this mission. Monday's planned launch was scrubbed due to weather. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.\n",

The offender, snapped on security footage in a fluoro orange sweatshirt and oversized  mask, is described as being 'very tall'. He made off with the dairy's till and about $1500 in cash on Saturday, Stuff.co.nz reports. A man in a 'distinctive' cartoon mask demanded cash from owner's daughter on Saturday Police were reportedly called to the Union St dairy, in east Christchurch at about 12.30pm, after receiving reports of a masked man demanding cash from the dairy owner's daughter. Christina Chen told reporters her 30-year-old daughter ran out of the shop screaming 'robber!'. The masked man threw the cash register to the ground and took off with the till drawer and up to $1,500. 'Normally they just rob cigarettes and some more things, it's not a big issue,' Chen told Stuff.co.nz. 'But this time they were scary because they wore a mask, and we don't know who it is.' Police say there were no signs of any weapons used but that the robber remained at large. They are asking anyone with information that may help to identify this person to call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or to message police online.\n",

      "    Article: Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has reminded Raheem Sterling and Jordon Ibe about their professional responsibilities and urged them to learn from a chastening week. Sterling, the England international who will lead Liverpool’s line at Wembley on Sunday in the absence of the injured Daniel Sturridge, was exposed for inhaling the legal high nitrous oxide on Monday. Then 24 hours later pictures emerged of Sterling and Ibe with shisha pipes. Raheem Sterling (right) was pictured smoking a shisha pipe with team-mate Jordon Ibe earlier this season Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers (left) hasn't disciplined Sterling (pictured) or Ibe for the incident Ibe was present among the Reds squad during their training session on Friday ahead of their FA Cup semi Rodgers, who has Steven Gerrard available for the FA Cup semi-final with Aston Villa, spoke to Sterling and Ibe in his office on Thursday but neither will be disciplined and Rodgers now wants to draw a line under the matter. He said: ‘It is understanding that when you are a professional, elite sportsperson, there are things you can and cannot be doing and be seen to be doing. ‘It’s not just for your welfare but also because of your responsibilities. ‘It is difficult. Some of these young guys are doing what you would consider to be normal things — and I’m not talking about this instance — (but) how it gets framed is totally different.’ Rodgers would not discuss whether he would give Gerrard, available after a three-match suspension, an immediate recall against Villa, making it clear that his sole priority is steering Liverpool into their first FA Cup final of his reign. They fell short in the title race last season and then faltered in the last four of the Capital One Cup in January, but Rodgers thinks they are ready to progress. Reds have captain Steven Gerrard (centre) back for their FA Cup semi after serving a three-match suspension ‘When you get so close, whether it was in the title race or the cup, it hurts,’ said Rodgers. ‘Trace back the winners in sport. If you look at everything they have won, also look at what they have lost. You will see that they go close on a number of occasions before they step on. ‘Look at players who have won Champions Leagues and you trace back and see they have also lost Champions League semi-finals and finals. It’s all part of the journey — losing but taking that forward and improving you.’ Rodgers (left) hasn't revealed whether he'll recall Gerrard for Sunday's clash against Aston Villa at Wembley\n",

      "    Article: Football Association chairman Greg Dyke has been handed the backing of five former England managers as he bids to push through radical changes. Dyke wants to increase the minimum number of home-grown players in club squads from eight to 12, however he is facing opposition from the Premier League. The proposals also include changing the rules so that 'home-grown' means having trained in England for three years before the age of 18 rather than before 21. FA chairman Greg Dyke (left), speaking with Premier League chief Richard Scudamore, wants to increase the number of homegrown players at top flight clubs Graham Taylor, Glenn Hoddle, Kevin Keegan, Sven-Goran Eriksson and Steve McClaren have signed a letter addressed to Dyke, the Daily Telegraph reports. According to the newspaper, the five former Three Lions bosses warn the English game will suffer if it blocks the proposals from Dyke and the FA's England Commission. 'We urge everyone in the English game to get behind them as quickly as possible,' the letter reportedly says. It adds: 'Failure to do so risks England falling further behind the leading football nations and will only make it harder to end the long wait to win the World Cup.' Former England managers (clockwise) Glenn Hoddle, Kevin Keegan, Steve McClaren and Sven-Goran Eriksson have backed Dyke's call Only 81 of the 220 Premier League starters in the last round of matches were eligible for England selection - a fairly pitiful 36.8 per cent. The managers add: 'There are many reasons why England has failed to win any major honours since 1966 and each of us bears a portion of that responsibility. 'However, as the England Commission's evidence has demonstrated, the pool of English talent playing at the very top level is shrinking and it's an undeniable fact that this is a clear disadvantage for any England manager.' The rise of Harry Kane (centre) proves that England can bring through talented youngsters A draw for England in Italy on Tuesday was a respectable result, and Roy Hodgson's team have encountered no trouble in their Euro 2016 qualifying group to date, winning all five of their matches. There are signs of encouragement with the emergence of a new generation of young players, the former England bosses reason. 'With promising players such as (Ross) Barkley, (Raheem) Sterling and (Harry) Kane starting to break through, it is clear we can still produce top young talent,' they write. 'The one thing they are not being offered is the most important of all: opportunity.'\n",

The former Manchester City striker's deal with the Serie A champions does not expire until the end of next season but he has reportedly told the club he wishes to leave this summer. Boca have confirmed they are close to completing a deal for the 31-year-old, but club president Daniel Angelici has stressed that Tevez must terminate his contract with the Italians first. Carlos Tevez has shocked Juventus by suggesting he wants to leave the club this summer Tevez is on course to win a second Serie A title with the Old Lady and still has a shot at European glory 'We must be careful', Angelici told TYC Sports. 'We know that he wants to return to Argentina with Boca Juniors but he must first terminate his contract with Juventus, which runs until 2016. 'We are close to sealing his return and it will be done shortly.' The Argentina international joined Boca's youth academy in 1996 and went on to score 26 league goals in 76 appearances for the club before joining Corinthians in 2005. Although Juventus are reluctant to lose the league's top scorer - Tevez has netted 17 times this season - they have accepted the player wants to leave and have already started identifying potential replacements.

'The most important thing for me is that Tevez continues to play as well as he is at the moment,' Martino told Italian paper Tuttosport. 'It doesn't matter whether that's at Juventus or Boca. Only he'll know what's best for his future. 'I will say this, though: Juventus are a great team, but so are Boca Juniors. It wouldn't be a step down.'\n",

The Iowa Board of Chiropractic released a report Wednesday detailing charges against Charles Manuel, of Lamoni. Manuel signed an agreement last month admitting his misdeeds and pledging not to apply for reinstatement for at least 10 years. Patient satisfaction: A chiropractor in Iowa has surrendered his license to practice and admitted to swapping services for sex and performing exorcisms on some patients. Nonetheless, he's received outstanding evaluations for patient satisfaction on HealthGrades.com The agreement requires that Manuel prove any circumstances surrounding the revocation of his license no longer exist before he can resume practicing chiropractic in the state. Those circumstances included bartering sex for services with some patients. Manuel also recommended that patients stop taking medication he prescribed to them. A woman who answered a call to Manuel's home from the Des Moines Register declined to comment on the case. A woman at his former practice said he hadn't worked there for some time. A Lamoni address listed on the Yelp page for Manuel's practice appears to be a home on a residential street. While Maneul has received just three patient survey responses on HealthGrades.com, those responses were quite positive. The disgraced chiropractor received a perfect five out of five stars in patient satisfaction.

Former Brazil defender Ze Maria was fired on Wednesday after a poor run, only to be reinstated the next day after flamboyant owner Angelo Massone decided to 'give the coaching staff another chance.' But the 41-year-old former Inter Milan and Parma right back, capped 25 times by Brazil, angered Massone again after Ceahlaul were beaten 2-0 by mid-table FC Botosani on Saturday. Ze Maria represented Brazil on 25 occasions during an international career spanning five years The result left Ceahlaul 16th in the standings, six points adrift of safety. Ze Maria replaced Florin Marin in January to become Ceahlaul's third coach this season. He will be replaced by Serbian Vanya Radinovic.\n",

      "    Article: A dress worn by Vivien Leigh when she played Scarlett O'Hara in the classic 1939 film Gone With the Wind has fetched $137,000 at auction. Heritage Auctions offered the gray jacket and skirt, featuring a black zigzag applique, plus more than 150 other items from the Academy Award-winning film at auction on Saturday in Beverly Hills, California. The dress - a jacket and full skirt ensemble - was worn in several key scenes in the 1939 movie, including when Scarlett O'Hara encounters Rhett Butler, played by Clark Gable, and when she gets attacked in the shanty town. Scroll down for video An outfit worn in several scenes of the 1939 film Gone With The Wind by Vivien Leigh as she played Scarlett O'Hara sold for $137,000 at auction on Saturday The dress - a jacket and full skirt ensemble - was worn in several key scenes in the 1939 movie but has suffered a little with age and has faded to light gray from original slate blue-gray color The outfit has suffered a little with age, however. When Leigh wore it in the movie, it was slate blue-gray but over the years it has faded to light gray. It was one of more than 150 items that were part of the private collection of James Tumblin, formerly in charge of the hair and makeup department at Universal Studios. Tumblin began collecting onscreen costumes, props and behind-the-scenes artifacts from the film in the 1960s, amassing a collection of more than 300,000 pieces of memorabilia. During a visit to the Western Costume Company he spotted the Scarlett O'Hara dress on the floor. He learned that the dress was about to be thrown away and negotiated a deal to buy it for $20. Tumblin has 'devoted his life and efforts to promoting Hollywood and this film, touring his items throughout the United States,' said Kathleen Guzman, managing director of Heritage Auctions. Gone With The Wind, which celebrated its 75th anniversary last year, was based on Margaret Mitchell's 1936 best-selling book about a spoiled Old South socialite, played by Vivien Leigh, and co-starred Clark gable as Rhett Butler Hattie McDaniel (left), Olivia DeHavilland (middle), and Vivien Leigh: McDaniel famously became the first African-American actor to be nominated for and win an Academy Award Other top selling items from the auction were a straw hat worn by Leigh that sold for $52,500; the trousers and jacket from a suit worn by Clark Gable as Rhett Butler, selling for $55,000; and a black bonnet worn by both Leigh and Olivia De Havilland as Melanie Wilkes, which fetched $30,000. Gone With The Wind, which celebrated its 75th anniversary last year, was based on Margaret Mitchell's 1936 best-selling book about a spoiled Old South socialite. Actress Hattie McDaniel, who played Scarlett's devoted nanny Mammy, a slave, famously became the first African-American actor to be nominated for and win an Academy Award.\n",

      "    Article: Chelsea have made an offer for FC Tokyo's 22-year-old forward Yoshinori Muto, according to club president Naoki Ogane. The Japan international, who has played for the J-League side since 2013, will join Chelsea's Dutch partner club Vitesse Arnhem on loan next season if he completes a move to Stamford Bridge this summer. Ogane claims that Chelsea's interest in Muto is not connected to the £200million sponsorship deal they signed with Japanese company Yokohama Rubber in February. FC Tokyo forward Yoshinori Muto (centre) brings the ball forward against Albirex Niigata in March FC Tokyo president Naoki Ogane claims that Chelsea have made a bid for Japan international Muto Muto tussles with Yuji Nakazawa of Yokohama F.Marinos during a J-League clash last month Age: 22 Club: FC Tokyo Appearances: 37 Goals: 16 International caps (Japan): 11 International goals: 1 Did you know? Muto graduated from Keio University in Tokyo with an economics degree two weeks ago Speaking to Sports Nippon, Ogane said: 'It is true that Chelsea sent us an offer for Muto. 'It is a formal offer with conditions. They want to acquire him in the summer.' Muto, who only graduated from Keio University a fortnight ago after completing an economics degree, would be the first Japanese player to represent Chelsea if he moves to west London. He has earned 11 caps for his country after signing his first professional contract in 2014, scoring once for the Samurai Blue. A £4million deal for the youngster has been mooted, but Muto admits that he isn't sure if he will join the Premier League title chasers despite being pleased with their bid. He said: 'I have not decided yet at all. It is an honour for me to receive this offer from a great club.' Muto scored 13 times in his debut season with FC Tokyo and was named in the J-League's best XI. Muto admits it is an 'honour' to receive an offer from Chelsea although he has not yet decided to join the club Muto, pictured in action against Ventforet Kofu has scored three goals in four games so far this season The 22-year-old has a shot at goal during Japan's Asian Cup match against Palestine in January this year He has continued his fine form during the current campaign, helping his club to third place in the division with three goals in four games. Yokohama Rubber - one of the world's largest tyre manufacturers - will become Chelsea's official shirt sponsors from the start of the 2015-16 season. The initial five-year deal is the biggest in the club's history, with the Blues now considering a two-week pre-season tour of Japan this summer.\n",

      "    Article: Nathan Hughes on Friday night had his ban for accidentally knocking out George North sensationally over-turned on appeal, following an outcry on his behalf. The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended for three matches, after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been ‘reckless’ for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion, as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27. Hughes was shown a red card for the offence, but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded. Although it was accepted that there had been no intent, the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing. Yet, in a stunning twist – and in light of fierce criticism – the ban was thrown out, as the appeal lodged by Wasps was up-held. Nathan Hughes's knee collided with George North's head as he crossed the line to score for Northampton North was left out cold on the pitch at Franklin's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher It was the third time that the Wales and Lions winger had been knocked out in the space of two months Fiji-born forward Hughes missed his side's Champions Cup quarter-final loss against Toulon last Sunday North was left unconscious by the clash; a third blow to the head in the space of two months. He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing, to counter-act his concussion symptoms. Graphic, slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin’s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes, but many more spoke up in his defence. Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended – and their dismay was shared by others outside the club. Captain James Haskell said: ‘Astounded would be an under-statement’, while fly-half Andy Goode added: ‘Really can’t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes. There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome.’ Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a ‘total joke’ and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment, calling it an ‘absolute joke’. Hughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27 Hughes missed his club’s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday, as he awaited his appeal hearing. He is now free to return to action immediately, but he is not in the match-day squad for Wasps’ Aviva Premiership trip to London Welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture, he is unlikely to play again until the visit of Exeter to Coventry on April 26. Jeremy Summers, chairman of the appeal hearing panel, said: ‘The appeal panel considered it appropriate to hear the matter afresh. Having done so and having had the advantage of evidence not before the original panel, it concluded that no act of foul play took place in that the incident occurred accidentally.’\n",

      "    Article: Jamie Carragher believes Brendan Rodgers is still the right man to lead Liverpool forward after a season with no trophies and a likely finish outside the top four. Rodgers' future at Anfield has been questioned after a third straight season without a trophy, but the former Liverpool defender backed the Reds manager. Speaking after collecting a Beacon Award for his community work on Merseyside on Tuesday, Carragher said: 'I don't think your whole future should be determined by one game. Jamie Carragher shared this image on Instagram after collecting a Beacon Award on Tuesday 'It was difficult with the players that came in and I still don't think many of them have bedded in yet.' Liverpool are seven points behind fourth placed Manchester City with a game in hand and look set to miss out on Champions League qualification for next season. Carragher added: 'Brendan, the players and the staff will be looking to next season and thinking they will go one step further, winning a trophy maybe and getting back into the top four. 'That's his job. He has to identify where in the team they need to improve; the squad is there and they did a lot of that last summer. Brendan Rodgers is under pressure at Liverpool after a third straight season without a trophy Liverpool were knocked out of the FA Cup by Aston Villa in a disappointing semi-final performance 'The signings have to be right, and if they are it will make a massive difference. If they're not they'll be back to where they are this season.' Carragher received a Beacon Award at a ceremony in London on Tuesday night for his community work on Merseyside. The 37-year-old, who played 737 games for Liverpool, has provided coaching in eight schools in deprived areas of Merseyside through his 23 Foundation. Carragher, pictured at the 26th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, backed Rodgers to stay at Anfield The former Liverpool defender added: 'I hope that I can give youngsters a lift and that extra push to realise their goals. Liverpool is a place that likes to see its own do well. It is a tight-knit community and growing up I got a lot of help and encouragement from people around me. 'I'm from an under-privileged area – Bootle in Liverpool. If I ever got the chance to help that area and the wider community I've always felt I would. 'There are plenty of philanthropists around the world who do great work and I am one of the many trying to do my little bit that will hopefully help people in my area.'\n",

      "    Article: A dress worn by Vivien Leigh when she played Scarlett O'Hara in the classic 1939 film Gone With the Wind has fetched $137,000 at auction. Heritage Auctions offered the gray jacket and skirt, featuring a black zigzag applique, plus more than 150 other items from the Academy Award-winning film at auction on Saturday in Beverly Hills, California. The dress - a jacket and full skirt ensemble - was worn in several key scenes in the 1939 movie, including when Scarlett O'Hara encounters Rhett Butler, played by Clark Gable, and when she gets attacked in the shanty town. Scroll down for video An outfit worn in several scenes of the 1939 film Gone With The Wind by Vivien Leigh as she played Scarlett O'Hara sold for $137,000 at auction on Saturday The dress - a jacket and full skirt ensemble - was worn in several key scenes in the 1939 movie but has suffered a little with age and has faded to light gray from original slate blue-gray color The outfit has suffered a little with age, however. When Leigh wore it in the movie, it was slate blue-gray but over the years it has faded to light gray. It was one of more than 150 items that were part of the private collection of James Tumblin, formerly in charge of the hair and makeup department at Universal Studios. Tumblin began collecting onscreen costumes, props and behind-the-scenes artifacts from the film in the 1960s, amassing a collection of more than 300,000 pieces of memorabilia. During a visit to the Western Costume Company he spotted the Scarlett O'Hara dress on the floor. He learned that the dress was about to be thrown away and negotiated a deal to buy it for $20. Tumblin has 'devoted his life and efforts to promoting Hollywood and this film, touring his items throughout the United States,' said Kathleen Guzman, managing director of Heritage Auctions. Gone With The Wind, which celebrated its 75th anniversary last year, was based on Margaret Mitchell's 1936 best-selling book about a spoiled Old South socialite, played by Vivien Leigh, and co-starred Clark gable as Rhett Butler Hattie McDaniel (left), Olivia DeHavilland (middle), and Vivien Leigh: McDaniel famously became the first African-American actor to be nominated for and win an Academy Award Other top selling items from the auction were a straw hat worn by Leigh that sold for $52,500; the trousers and jacket from a suit worn by Clark Gable as Rhett Butler, selling for $55,000; and a black bonnet worn by both Leigh and Olivia De Havilland as Melanie Wilkes, which fetched $30,000. Gone With The Wind, which celebrated its 75th anniversary last year, was based on Margaret Mitchell's 1936 best-selling book about a spoiled Old South socialite. Actress Hattie McDaniel, who played Scarlett's devoted nanny Mammy, a slave, famously became the first African-American actor to be nominated for and win an Academy Award.\n",

The 69-year-old collaborated with NBC's Today show to launch a contest for one Elvis-obsessed couple to win the 'ultimate wedding'. The winning duo - announced next Monday - will tie the knot at Elvis Presley's Graceland Wedding Chapel inside the Westgate Hotel on Thursday, April 23. Novel idea: Priscilla Presley will serve as a witness at the first wedding to be held at an all new chapel of love in Las Vegas Westgate, formerly the Las Vegas Hilton, is where Elvis performed more than 830 sold-out shows. Along with the singer's former wife in the audience, the winning couple will  win a free wedding reception and hotel suite for two nights. To top it off, airfares and concert tickets to the Elvis Experience theater show will also be thrown in. While Priscilla agreed to make an appearance, the woman who wed Elvis in 1967 made one thing clear before unveiling the latest wedding chapel to bear his name: No impersonators. 'This is all first-class,' she told the Associated Press recently. 'This is not a joke. The wedding chapel is not a joke.' The actress and business magnate has been involved in the look and feel of the chapel that officials say is part of the first permanent Graceland exhibit of the singer's artifacts outside his iconic Memphis, Tennessee, home. Couples wanting to be the first  to  wed at the Elvis Presley's Graceland Wedding Chapel must submit a video or photos along with an explanation detailing why they deserve the prize.

Lindegaard tied the knot with the Swedish model last year in a romantic beach wedding in Mauritius. And the United goalkeeper, who has struggled for minutes throughout his career in Manchester, was keen to remind fans via his Instagram page of his marriage to stunning Beqiri. Manchester United goalkeeper Anders Lindegaard made the most of the English weather with Misse Beqiri Lindegaard tied the knot with the stunning model last year and the couple have a son together Danish international Lindegaard posted a link to Beqiri's Instagram account with the message: 'Day off with my sunshine @missebeqiri #cheshire #manchester' The Swedish beauty, who has Albanian roots, likes to flaunt her good looks on Instagram and regularly posts pictures while she's modelling at work. Lindegaard and Beqiri, who have a son together, have been dating since 2012. The 31-year-old moved to the Premier League in 2010 after signing from Norwegian side Aalesunds but has failed to make an impact. Beqiri, who is Swedish but has Albanian roots, regularly posts modelling photos on her Instagram page With over 17,000 followers on Instagram, Beqiri made sure she showed her new haircut to her legion of fans Lindegaard and Beqiri have been dating since 2012 and they married in a romantic Mauritius beach wedding In five seasons, he has made just 19 league appearances and has been restricted to cup matches during his time in Manchester. With David de Gea in exceptional form under Louis van Gaal and Victor Valdes signing for the Red Devils in January, Lindegaard is now third-choice at Old Trafford. Lindergaard, who has been told he can leave United, was linked with a move to FC Midtjylland in January but the two clubs could not agree on a price. But despite his failure on the pitch, he's definitely winning away from it. The Denmark international (right) has struggled for regular football at Old Trafford since arriving in 2010\n",

      "    Article: These extraordinary images show how an enormous jumbo jet has been converted into a luxury home for a mystery billionaire - complete with bedrooms, multiple lounges and an onboard restaurant. The custom-built Boeing 747 is believed to have cost its ultra-wealthy owner £400million after it was customised to fit his specifications exactly over a three-year period. The jumbo jet would normally carry as many as 600 passengers - but this version was built for just a single tycoon, although he will be able to fit dozens of guests. It contains a large dining room where travellers can enjoy meals cooked in an adjoining kitchen, with a lounge and 'state room' at the back of the plane. More sleeping space is provided in the 'aeroloft' on the top deck of the vessel, with eight full beds for passengers who prefer to get some shut-eye on flights. Luxury: This is the lounge on board a custom-built Boeing 747-8, as depicted in an artist's impression by Greenpoint Technologies Shuteye: The master bedroom of the £400million plane has a huge bed as well as an armchair and sofa for when the owner needs to relax Business: The conference room of the plane could be perfect for meetings in the sky with its long table in the centre Chill-out: The lounge decor looks like a luxury hotel, belying its true location inside a plane similar to those used by commercial airlines Executive: This room, which can be used as an office or a guest bedroom, gives a hint to its true location thanks to the porthole-style windows Kicking back: The main suite could easily be mistaken for a room in a top hotel thanks to its over-the-top decorations Restaurant: The central portion of the plane hosts a dining room which is attached to a kitchen, allowing the owner to make use of the services of a private chef Shiny: The jumbo jet is one of the most luxurious private planes ever built, with the price tag believed to have reached a total of £400million Sofa: Parts of the plane are set aside for guests to relax while watching television, as the vessel can carry several dozen passengers Plush: Another artist's impression of the main state room, which also contains a desk so the owner can switch between work and relaxation Welcoming: Images of the lounge show a space very different to the normal aeroplane cabin, with the traditional rows of seats completely discarded in favour of a hotel-like ambience Exclusive: Few people can ever imagine flying in this sort of luxury - far more glitzy than first class on commercial flights Plan: The layout of the Boeing 747 is shown in this plan published by Greenpoint Technologies Gigantic: The luxury interior has been built inside a Boeing 747-8 similar to this one, which can hold up to 600 passengers\n",

      "    Article: Mexican restaurant Chipotle has decided to tap into the $70 billion food delivery market by teaming up with an app to bring burritos straight to customers' doors. The fast-casual chain will work with the Postmates app to begin offering delivery for online and mobile orders in 67 cities, according to a report in Nation's Restaurant News. But Mexican food fans should know that the restaurant plans to add a nine per cent service charge - with the delivery fees for Postmates beginning at $5 and up, depending on distance and demand. New venture: Mexican restaurant Chipotle has decided to tap into the $70 billion food delivery market by teaming up with an app to bring burritos straight to customers' doors Chipotle is thought to have turned down previous offers of collaboration with third-party delivery services - but has now given Postmates the green light, New York Daily News reports. The app hires independent contractors who drive their own cars in a similar model to Uber taxis. Chipotle has gone from strength to strength in recent years and this month two presidential candidates have been spotted in their restaurants. Republican contender Marco Rubio is a regular in the outlets and recently told MailOnline that he always tips staff. Cashing on delivery market: The fast-casual chain will work with the Postmates app to begin offering delivery for online and mobile orders in 67 cities And just one day into her presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton was seen in a Chipotle in Maumee, Ohio where she ordered a chicken dish with guacamole, a chicken salad and fruit juice. Chipotle is not the only franchise hoping to cash in on the lucrative delivery market. Starbucks, which will deliver cups of coffee in parts of Seattle and New York by the end of the year, has also partnered with Postmates. Taco Bell recently announced plans to test a delivery service this year, McDonald's 'McDelivery' program is in the planning process and Burger King has launched a pilot program in select markets, including parts of New York City, through bkdelivers.com.

'It's not as though I was watching hoping he wouldn't score for England, I'm genuinely pleased for him and fair play to him – it was a great goal,' Merson said. 'It's just a matter of opinion, and my opinion was that he got pulled off after half an hour at Manchester United in front of Roy Hodgson, so he shouldn't have been in the squad.

      "    Article: Nathan Hughes on Friday night had his ban for accidentally knocking out George North sensationally over-turned on appeal, following an outcry on his behalf. The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended for three matches, after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been ‘reckless’ for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion, as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27. Hughes was shown a red card for the offence, but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded. Although it was accepted that there had been no intent, the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing. Yet, in a stunning twist – and in light of fierce criticism – the ban was thrown out, as the appeal lodged by Wasps was up-held. Nathan Hughes's knee collided with George North's head as he crossed the line to score for Northampton North was left out cold on the pitch at Franklin's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher It was the third time that the Wales and Lions winger had been knocked out in the space of two months Fiji-born forward Hughes missed his side's Champions Cup quarter-final loss against Toulon last Sunday North was left unconscious by the clash; a third blow to the head in the space of two months. He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing, to counter-act his concussion symptoms. Graphic, slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin’s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes, but many more spoke up in his defence. Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended – and their dismay was shared by others outside the club. Captain James Haskell said: ‘Astounded would be an under-statement’, while fly-half Andy Goode added: ‘Really can’t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes. There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome.’ Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a ‘total joke’ and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment, calling it an ‘absolute joke’. Hughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27 Hughes missed his club’s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday, as he awaited his appeal hearing. He is now free to return to action immediately, but he is not in the match-day squad for Wasps’ Aviva Premiership trip to London Welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture, he is unlikely to play again until the visit of Exeter to Coventry on April 26. Jeremy Summers, chairman of the appeal hearing panel, said: ‘The appeal panel considered it appropriate to hear the matter afresh. Having done so and having had the advantage of evidence not before the original panel, it concluded that no act of foul play took place in that the incident occurred accidentally.’\n",

      "    Article: Thousands of holidaymakers caught up in last summer’s passport delay fiasco have not received any compensation. At the same time, managers at the passport agency, which made a £42 million profit during the chaos, received up to £3,500 in bonuses. Ministers refused to give a blanket refund to the desperate families who had to pay extra to get their travel documents rushed through, and even to some who missed out on trips. Scroll down for video The boxes of passport applications piled up at in office in Liverpool at the peak of the backlog last summer Keith Vaz, who as chairman of the Home Affairs Committee led the calls for compensation, said last night: ‘I am astonished so few people have been given compensation for what was a fiasco presided over by the management of the passport office, especially as they made a profit last year that ran into millions of pounds.’ The problems began a year ago as HM Passport Office struggled to cope with 3.6 million Britons applying for documents. By mid-June there were more than half a million passports stuck in the system. Ministers agreed to give urgent cases a free upgrade to the fast-track service, but thousands had already paid the extra £30 per passport for this. Many still missed trips because their passports did not arrive in time. Details obtained by The Mail on Sunday show scarcely any of the thousands of holidaymakers caught up in the chaos ever got anything back from the Passport Office. In total just 2,191 compensation applications were approved between April last year and January this year, scarcely changed from 2,077 for the previous year. The total paid out was £203,066, giving an average sum of £92.68. The biggest single payout was £5,463; the lowest £1. The Passport Office said it could not say how many claims were rejected, partly because of ‘the system failure of our customer complaint database’. It can be revealed however that Ministers rejected a demand by the Home Affairs Select Committee for all those left out of pocket to be compensated, saying: ‘It would create a precedent.’ Home Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz led the calls for compensation and was 'astonished' to learn just 2,191 compensation applications were approved This newspaper contacted more than a dozen holidaymakers who had either missed trips or had to pay extra to get passports in time. Only one had got money back. Among those refused were Mathew Bean and Hayley Kirkham. They lost close to £1,500 on a trip to Morocco, where he had planned to propose, because their passports did not arrive in time – even though they had applied ten weeks before they were due to travel and paid for upgrades. HM Passport Office made a surplus of £42.3 million between April and October last year. In 2013-14, the most recent figures available, managers were handed a total of £1.8 million in bonuses, with the average reward £499 and the highest £3,500.\n",

The Iowa Board of Chiropractic released a report Wednesday detailing charges against Charles Manuel, of Lamoni. Manuel signed an agreement last month admitting his misdeeds and pledging not to apply for reinstatement for at least 10 years. Patient satisfaction: A chiropractor in Iowa has surrendered his license to practice and admitted to swapping services for sex and performing exorcisms on some patients. Nonetheless, he's received outstanding evaluations for patient satisfaction on HealthGrades.com The agreement requires that Manuel prove any circumstances surrounding the revocation of his license no longer exist before he can resume practicing chiropractic in the state. Those circumstances included bartering sex for services with some patients. Manuel also recommended that patients stop taking medication he prescribed to them. A woman who answered a call to Manuel's home from the Des Moines Register declined to comment on the case. A woman at his former practice said he hadn't worked there for some time. A Lamoni address listed on the Yelp page for Manuel's practice appears to be a home on a residential street. While Maneul has received just three patient survey responses on HealthGrades.com, those responses were quite positive. The disgraced chiropractor received a perfect five out of five stars in patient satisfaction.

The bereaved mother, named Dawn, was appearing on The Jeremy Kyle show and accused long-term chum, convicted burglar Jamie, of making off with the cash. When one of Mr Kyle's famous lie detector tests revealed that Jamie, who lives with Dawn and her partner who is also called Jamie, had done the deed, she burst into tears and stormed off. Scroll down for video Devastated: Dawn, who has had seven miscarriages, was furious to discover her friend had stolen from her The drama began when Dawn, who has previously appeared on the ITV talk show, discovered that £207 set aside for a £500 grave stone had disappeared. Suspecting house-mate Jamie and his girlfriend Carol, she confronted them but was initially met with a flat denial. 'Only him and Carol knew where it was,' she said during an angry confrontation on the ITV show. 'Me and Jamie had been saving up and only Carol knew where it was.' Unable to prove it, she asked Mr Kyle to conduct a lie detector test and when the results came back, it showed that Jamie had indeed taken the cash. Caught out: Jamie, who has been to prison for burglary, was found to be lying after taking a test Outraged: Dawn, who was going to spend the money on a gravestone, was left furious by the revelation Mr Kyle also revealed that Jamie had sent a Facebook message to Dawn during the journey to London in which he declared his undying love and confessed to taking the money but blamed it on girlfriend Carol. Speaking after the show, a sobbing Dawn said:  'I've had seven miscarriages and only one of them I've had to bury. 'That was Daniel James and the £207 was put aside because the head stone was going to cost £500 altogether. 'We had to stand there and say goodbye to Daniel James and the last thing I wanted to do for Daniel James was put a head stone on him so he knew how much his mummy and daddy loved him. I feel betrayed, horrible. You try and do a good gesture to people and then you get it thrown in your face.'

The Foxes are currently seven points adrift at the bottom of the table, with only eight games remaining, knowing that time is running out to save themselves. Cambiasso refuses to give up and admits that keeping Leicester up will feel like winning a trophy. Esteban Cambiasso says that helping keep Leicester in the Premier League will feel like winning a trophy 'For me, it's like another cup,' he told BBC East Midlands Today. 'When you start another season you have an objective, and this is the objective for us. 'For me, winning a cup or winning the league with another team is the same now as having the possibility to save Leicester in the Premier League.' The Argentinian midfielder poses with the trophy after his team won the 2010 FIFA Club World Cup Cambiasso had an illustrious career at Inter Milan, winning an impressive 15 trophies during his stint River Plate (2001-2002) Argentine Primera Division Real Madrid (2002-2004) La Liga Super Cup Supercopa de Espana Inter Milan (2004-2014) Champions League Serie A (5) Coppa Italia (4) Supercoppa (4) FIFA Club World Cup Having not won a game since January, Nigel Pearson's men face West Ham United on Saturday and Cambiasso is still convinced they can avoid the drop. 'I understood when I signed for Leicester it's not an easy job to stay in the Premier League,' he said. 'It's a difficult situation but I think we have our chances to win matches. There's a quarter of the Premier League left to finish. 'I think some people think for Leicester all is finished. But I'm sure, because I watch my team-mates every day, we can save Leicester and stay in the Premier League.' The former Inter Milan star signed for the Foxes in the summer, leaving Italy after ten years and embarking on a new challenge in England. After agreeing to a one-year-deal, Cambiasso has quickly established himself as a key player but it remains to be seen if he'll still be in the East Midlands at the start of next season. The former Real Madrid man was also successful during his short spell in Spain for Real Madrid Cambiasso played during Real's 'Galatico' era, with Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo and David Beckham 'Leicester always wanted me,' he added. 'After these nine months or eight months, I'm very happy because my family is OK, and I'm good. 'I want a few more points, but all the rest is perfect.'

      "    Article: Steve Bruce is adamant he can keep Hull City in the Barclays Premier League after a 2-0 defeat by Southampton left them battling to stay up. At the start of the campaign Bruce was targeting 10 wins to survive, but despite a strong start his Hull side have mustered just six and he is hoping 'nine or eight might be enough.' Hull were the better side against Southampton for the first 45 minutes but a James Ward-Prowse penalty and late strike from Graziano Pelle meant they left with nothing. Steve Bruce is confident he can keep Hull City in the Premier League this season and avoid relegation They now have six games to save their season including nightmare fixtures against Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United. But Bruce insisted: 'Everyone is up for the challenge and I'm sure and convinced that we'll do it. If we keep remaining positive I'm convinced we can take a couple of results which will take us over the line. 'We've had a wonderful three years near enough from getting promoted to getting to a cup final, staying up last year. I've always had something in my water that this season would be the most difficult because all of a sudden you've created an expectation and unfortunately we haven't been able to live up to that expectation. Hull were beaten 2-0 by Southampton on Saturday and are just two points clear of the drop zone 'We've got our reasons for it, we've still got enough to keep us out of trouble I hope. We're bang in it but I'm still convinced we'll get out of it.' Bruce puts their struggles down to several long-term injuries to key players. At St Mary's Stadium, Mohamed Diame returned from five months out and James Chester from three. Michael Dawson and Nikica Jelavic have missed half the season and Robert Snodgrass has not been available at all. Bruce added: 'They are big players for us and unfortunately, at this moment, we haven't been able to cope. We've battled on manfully but not quite been good enough.' James Ward-Prowse slots home a penalty for Southampton against Hull as they moved up to fifth Ronald Koeman's side moved to fifth in the table ahead of Tottenham, who lost to Aston Villa, and Liverpool, who play Newcastle on Monday. But the Dutchman left with his own problems, after he had to intervene when Sadio Mane tried to take the penalty when Ward-Prowse was first-choice. Koeman will speak to his squad to remind them that team rules cannot be broken by anyone. Koeman said: 'I already had a word with Mane but we will talk to the team about that because maybe I have to mention it a bit more clearly.'\n",

      "    Article: (CNN)Lady Antebellum singer Hillary Scott's tour bus caught fire on a Texas freeway Thursday morning, but everyone on board was safely evacuated. Michael Barnett captured dramatic video of the fire, on Interstate 30 just northeast of Dallas, and uploaded it to CNN iReport. Smoke and flames poured from the rear of the bus as traffic slowed to a crawl and Barnett slowly approached in his vehicle. As he drew closer to the bus, Barnett decided to stop filming because he didn't know what to expect. \"It was shocking,\" he said. \"I didn't know what I was about to see. I didn't know if anyone was hurt.\" Barnett said he didn't realize at the time that the bus belonged to the country band. Hillary Scott, co-lead singer for the band, posted a photo of the charred bus on Instagram and noted that she, her husband, the tour manager and the driver were all evacuated safely. \"Thanking God for our safety and the safety of all of those who helped put this fire out and keep us safe,\" she wrote. The tour manager told CNN affiliate KTVT that the bus stopped after a rear tire blew out. It burst into flames after everyone had gotten off. Scott also posted an Instagram photo and message saying that the fire destroyed everything in the bus's back lounge except her Bible. The band's two other members, Charles Kelley and Dave Haywood, were not traveling on the bus, KTVT reported. Lady Antebellum is set to perform at the 50th Academy of Country Music Awards on Sunday in Arlington, Texas.\n",

And the United goalkeeper, who has struggled for minutes throughout his career in Manchester, was keen to remind fans via his Instagram page of his marriage to stunning Beqiri.

The former Manchester City striker's deal with the Serie A champions does not expire until the end of next season but he has reportedly told the club he wishes to leave this summer. Boca have confirmed they are close to completing a deal for the 31-year-old, but club president Daniel Angelici has stressed that Tevez must terminate his contract with the Italians first. Carlos Tevez has shocked Juventus by suggesting he wants to leave the club this summer Tevez is on course to win a second Serie A title with the Old Lady and still has a shot at European glory 'We must be careful', Angelici told TYC Sports. 'We know that he wants to return to Argentina with Boca Juniors but he must first terminate his contract with Juventus, which runs until 2016. 'We are close to sealing his return and it will be done shortly.' The Argentina international joined Boca's youth academy in 1996 and went on to score 26 league goals in 76 appearances for the club before joining Corinthians in 2005. Although Juventus are reluctant to lose the league's top scorer - Tevez has netted 17 times this season - they have accepted the player wants to leave and have already started identifying potential replacements. Italian paper Tuttosport claims the 31-year-old has already decided to leave the club this summer Tevez has always said he intends to finish his career back at his first club Boca Juniors in Argentina Carlos Tevez                             17 Mauro Icardi                              16 Jeremy Menez                          16 Tevez's international manager Tata Martino claims any potential move would have no bearing on the player's Argentina future. 'The most important thing for me is that Tevez continues to play as well as he is at the moment,' Martino told Italian paper Tuttosport. 'It doesn't matter whether that's at Juventus or Boca. Only he'll know what's best for his future. 'I will say this, though: Juventus are a great team, but so are Boca Juniors. It wouldn't be a step down.'\n",

      "    Article: (CNN)A North Pacific gray whale has earned a spot in the record books after completing the longest migration of a mammal ever recorded. The whale, named Varvara, swam nearly 14,000 miles (22,500 kilometers), according to a release from Oregon State University, whose scientists helped conduct the whale-tracking study. Varvara, which is Russian for \"Barbara,\" left her primary feeding ground off Russia's Sakhalin Island to cross the  Pacific Ocean and down the West Coast of the United States to Baja, Mexico. Varvara's journey surpassed a record listed on the Guinness Worlds Records website. It said the previous record was set by a humpback whale that swam a mere 10,190-mile round trip between the \"warm breeding waters near the equator and the colder food-rich waters of the Arctic and Antarctic regions.\" Records are nice, but Bruce Mate, the lead author of the study, thinks the long trip might say more about the whale than just its ability to swim. During her 14,000-mile journey, Varvara visited \"three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales,\" which was a surprise to Mate, who is also the director of the Marine Mammal Institute at Oregon State University. \"For her to go to Mexico,\" Mate said, \"It's pretty strong evidence that it's where she's from.\" Varvara was thought to be an endangered western whale, but her ability to \"navigate across open water over tremendously long distances is impressive,\" he said in the release, which could mean that some western gray whales are actually eastern grays. With only 150 western gray whales believed to be in existence, that number might be even lower. \"Past studies have indicated genetic differentiation between the species, but this suggests we may need to take a closer look,\" Mate said.

      "    Article: Outspoken MP Bob Katter has risked being drawn into a race row after accusing the Queensland Government of believing embattled MP Billy Gordon was 'a little black puppet on a string'. In a bizarre statement on his party's website, Mr Katter said the Government believes Mr Gordon would quit after he was recently accused of domestic violence - and later admitted to his criminal past. Mr Katter, federal MP for Kennedy, is of Lebanese descent. He said he's been personally subjected to racist attitudes from both major parties in the past, and that he sympathised with Mr Gordon's position. Federal MP Bob Katter, who released a statement today accusing the Queensland Government of assuming Billy Gordon would quit after he was recently accused of domestic violence Mr Gordon was forced to quit the Queensland Labor Party last week in the wake of being accused of domestic violence and withholding his criminal history from Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk . He announced on Wednesday he will remain in the Queensland parliament as an independent, throwing the Government, which holds a razor-thin majority, into chaos. 'In the last two cases where this occurred in the federal parliament, there was never any question raised about the member resigning. So why was it assumed here that Billy Gordon would resign?' Mr Katter's statement reads. 'I can't help but think that the Queensland Government thought they had a little black puppet on a string. Mr Gordon, who  was forced to quit the Queensland Labor Party last week in the wake of being accused of domestic violence and withholding his criminal history The statement has sparked criticism on social media, with users questioning his terminology.

Not that John wrote: 'Wow, Bob Katter calls Billy Gordon, 'black puppet on a string' and the lefty loons stay silent. What if Abbott had said it?' The statement has sparked criticism on social media, with some users questioning his terminology Mr Katter has since defended the statement, saying he used the term black puppet in light of his personal experiences Mr Katter has since defended the statement, saying he used the term black puppet 'because I'm dark and I come from Cloncurry.' 'I can understand and I can identify with the attitudes that these people have and I'm going to call it for what it is,' he said. 'I deliberately put that comment in with a forethought, because I think they deserve a belting for the racial overtones.' Mr Katter used federal MPs Tony Windsor and Rob Oakeshott as examples of independents becoming puppets for the government and sacrificing their independence, but he vowed Mr Gordon would not make that mistake.\n",

      "    Article: Thousands of holidaymakers caught up in last summer’s passport delay fiasco have not received any compensation. At the same time, managers at the passport agency, which made a £42 million profit during the chaos, received up to £3,500 in bonuses. Ministers refused to give a blanket refund to the desperate families who had to pay extra to get their travel documents rushed through, and even to some who missed out on trips. Scroll down for video The boxes of passport applications piled up at in office in Liverpool at the peak of the backlog last summer Keith Vaz, who as chairman of the Home Affairs Committee led the calls for compensation, said last night: ‘I am astonished so few people have been given compensation for what was a fiasco presided over by the management of the passport office, especially as they made a profit last year that ran into millions of pounds.’ The problems began a year ago as HM Passport Office struggled to cope with 3.6 million Britons applying for documents. By mid-June there were more than half a million passports stuck in the system. Ministers agreed to give urgent cases a free upgrade to the fast-track service, but thousands had already paid the extra £30 per passport for this. Many still missed trips because their passports did not arrive in time. Details obtained by The Mail on Sunday show scarcely any of the thousands of holidaymakers caught up in the chaos ever got anything back from the Passport Office. In total just 2,191 compensation applications were approved between April last year and January this year, scarcely changed from 2,077 for the previous year. The total paid out was £203,066, giving an average sum of £92.68. The biggest single payout was £5,463; the lowest £1. The Passport Office said it could not say how many claims were rejected, partly because of ‘the system failure of our customer complaint database’. It can be revealed however that Ministers rejected a demand by the Home Affairs Select Committee for all those left out of pocket to be compensated, saying: ‘It would create a precedent.’ Home Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz led the calls for compensation and was 'astonished' to learn just 2,191 compensation applications were approved This newspaper contacted more than a dozen holidaymakers who had either missed trips or had to pay extra to get passports in time. Only one had got money back. Among those refused were Mathew Bean and Hayley Kirkham. They lost close to £1,500 on a trip to Morocco, where he had planned to propose, because their passports did not arrive in time – even though they had applied ten weeks before they were due to travel and paid for upgrades. HM Passport Office made a surplus of £42.3 million between April and October last year. In 2013-14, the most recent figures available, managers were handed a total of £1.8 million in bonuses, with the average reward £499 and the highest £3,500.\n",

'The stunning performance in Israel has created a huge buzz around Chris Coleman's team and the FAW has been inundated with orders for tickets,' the Football Association of Wales said in a statement on its website. 'Due to overwhelming demand, general admission tickets for the European qualifiers match between Wales and Belgium at the Cardiff City Stadium have now sold out.' It is understood the Wales squad prefer to play at the Cardiff City Stadium rather than the Millennium Stadium There had been speculation that Wales would play Belgium at the 74,500 capacity Millennium Stadium with so much interest in the match. But that was never going to happen as UEFA rules prevent the venue being changed within 120 days of the scheduled date. It is understood Gareth Bale and company would prefer playing at the more intimate Cardiff City Stadium rather than the Millennium Stadium, where they have not played since meeting England in a Euro 2012 qualifier in March 2011.\n",

      "    Article: Outspoken MP Bob Katter has risked being drawn into a race row after accusing the Queensland Government of believing embattled MP Billy Gordon was 'a little black puppet on a string'. In a bizarre statement on his party's website, Mr Katter said the Government believes Mr Gordon would quit after he was recently accused of domestic violence - and later admitted to his criminal past. Mr Katter, federal MP for Kennedy, is of Lebanese descent. He said he's been personally subjected to racist attitudes from both major parties in the past, and that he sympathised with Mr Gordon's position. Federal MP Bob Katter, who released a statement today accusing the Queensland Government of assuming Billy Gordon would quit after he was recently accused of domestic violence Mr Gordon was forced to quit the Queensland Labor Party last week in the wake of being accused of domestic violence and withholding his criminal history from Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk . He announced on Wednesday he will remain in the Queensland parliament as an independent, throwing the Government, which holds a razor-thin majority, into chaos. 'In the last two cases where this occurred in the federal parliament, there was never any question raised about the member resigning. So why was it assumed here that Billy Gordon would resign?' Mr Katter's statement reads. 'I can't help but think that the Queensland Government thought they had a little black puppet on a string. Mr Gordon, who  was forced to quit the Queensland Labor Party last week in the wake of being accused of domestic violence and withholding his criminal history The statement has sparked criticism on social media, with users questioning his terminology. 'Irrespective of his weird use of the term 'black puppet' it's kinda odd how Bob Katter is speaking on Billy Gordon's behalf' wrote Benjamin James. Not that John wrote: 'Wow, Bob Katter calls Billy Gordon, 'black puppet on a string' and the lefty loons stay silent. What if Abbott had said it?' The statement has sparked criticism on social media, with some users questioning his terminology Mr Katter has since defended the statement, saying he used the term black puppet in light of his personal experiences Mr Katter has since defended the statement, saying he used the term black puppet 'because I'm dark and I come from Cloncurry.' 'I can understand and I can identify with the attitudes that these people have and I'm going to call it for what it is,' he said. 'I deliberately put that comment in with a forethought, because I think they deserve a belting for the racial overtones.' Mr Katter used federal MPs Tony Windsor and Rob Oakeshott as examples of independents becoming puppets for the government and sacrificing their independence, but he vowed Mr Gordon would not make that mistake.\n",

The offender, snapped on security footage in a fluoro orange sweatshirt and oversized  mask, is described as being 'very tall'. He made off with the dairy's till and about $1500 in cash on Saturday, Stuff.co.nz reports. A man in a 'distinctive' cartoon mask demanded cash from owner's daughter on Saturday Police were reportedly called to the Union St dairy, in east Christchurch at about 12.30pm, after receiving reports of a masked man demanding cash from the dairy owner's daughter. Christina Chen told reporters her 30-year-old daughter ran out of the shop screaming 'robber!'. The masked man threw the cash register to the ground and took off with the till drawer and up to $1,500. 'Normally they just rob cigarettes and some more things, it's not a big issue,' Chen told Stuff.co.nz. 'But this time they were scary because they wore a mask, and we don't know who it is.' Police say there were no signs of any weapons used but that the robber remained at large. They are asking anyone with information that may help to identify this person to call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or to message police online.\n",

Heritage Auctions offered the gray jacket and skirt, featuring a black zigzag applique, plus more than 150 other items from the Academy Award-winning film at auction on Saturday in Beverly Hills, California. The dress - a jacket and full skirt ensemble - was worn in several key scenes in the 1939 movie, including when Scarlett O'Hara encounters Rhett Butler, played by Clark Gable, and when she gets attacked in the shanty town. Scroll down for video An outfit worn in several scenes of the 1939 film Gone With The Wind by Vivien Leigh as she played Scarlett O'Hara sold for $137,000 at auction on Saturday The dress - a jacket and full skirt ensemble - was worn in several key scenes in the 1939 movie but has suffered a little with age and has faded to light gray from original slate blue-gray color The outfit has suffered a little with age, however. When Leigh wore it in the movie, it was slate blue-gray but over the years it has faded to light gray. It was one of more than 150 items that were part of the private collection of James Tumblin, formerly in charge of the hair and makeup department at Universal Studios. Tumblin began collecting onscreen costumes, props and behind-the-scenes artifacts from the film in the 1960s, amassing a collection of more than 300,000 pieces of memorabilia. During a visit to the Western Costume Company he spotted the Scarlett O'Hara dress on the floor. He learned that the dress was about to be thrown away and negotiated a deal to buy it for $20. Tumblin has 'devoted his life and efforts to promoting Hollywood and this film, touring his items throughout the United States,' said Kathleen Guzman, managing director of Heritage Auctions. Gone With The Wind, which celebrated its 75th anniversary last year, was based on Margaret Mitchell's 1936 best-selling book about a spoiled Old South socialite, played by Vivien Leigh, and co-starred Clark gable as Rhett Butler Hattie McDaniel (left), Olivia DeHavilland (middle), and Vivien Leigh: McDaniel famously became the first African-American actor to be nominated for and win an Academy Award Other top selling items from the auction were a straw hat worn by Leigh that sold for $52,500; the trousers and jacket from a suit worn by Clark Gable as Rhett Butler, selling for $55,000; and a black bonnet worn by both Leigh and Olivia De Havilland as Melanie Wilkes, which fetched $30,000. Gone With The Wind, which celebrated its 75th anniversary last year, was based on Margaret Mitchell's 1936 best-selling book about a spoiled Old South socialite.

      "    Article: (CNN)Lady Antebellum singer Hillary Scott's tour bus caught fire on a Texas freeway Thursday morning, but everyone on board was safely evacuated. Michael Barnett captured dramatic video of the fire, on Interstate 30 just northeast of Dallas, and uploaded it to CNN iReport. Smoke and flames poured from the rear of the bus as traffic slowed to a crawl and Barnett slowly approached in his vehicle. As he drew closer to the bus, Barnett decided to stop filming because he didn't know what to expect. \"It was shocking,\" he said. \"I didn't know what I was about to see. I didn't know if anyone was hurt.\" Barnett said he didn't realize at the time that the bus belonged to the country band. Hillary Scott, co-lead singer for the band, posted a photo of the charred bus on Instagram and noted that she, her husband, the tour manager and the driver were all evacuated safely. \"Thanking God for our safety and the safety of all of those who helped put this fire out and keep us safe,\" she wrote. The tour manager told CNN affiliate KTVT that the bus stopped after a rear tire blew out. It burst into flames after everyone had gotten off. Scott also posted an Instagram photo and message saying that the fire destroyed everything in the bus's back lounge except her Bible. The band's two other members, Charles Kelley and Dave Haywood, were not traveling on the bus, KTVT reported. Lady Antebellum is set to perform at the 50th Academy of Country Music Awards on Sunday in Arlington, Texas.\n",

The offender, snapped on security footage in a fluoro orange sweatshirt and oversized  mask, is described as being 'very tall'. He made off with the dairy's till and about $1500 in cash on Saturday, Stuff.co.nz reports. A man in a 'distinctive' cartoon mask demanded cash from owner's daughter on Saturday Police were reportedly called to the Union St dairy, in east Christchurch at about 12.30pm, after receiving reports of a masked man demanding cash from the dairy owner's daughter. Christina Chen told reporters her 30-year-old daughter ran out of the shop screaming 'robber!'. The masked man threw the cash register to the ground and took off with the till drawer and up to $1,500. 'Normally they just rob cigarettes and some more things, it's not a big issue,' Chen told Stuff.co.nz. 'But this time they were scary because they wore a mask, and we don't know who it is.' Police say there were no signs of any weapons used but that the robber remained at large. They are asking anyone with information that may help to identify this person to call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or to message police online.\n",

      "    Article: (CNN)A fiery sunset greeted people in Washington Sunday. The deep reddish color caught Seattle native Tim Durkan's eye. He photographed a handful of aerial shots of the sunset warming the city's skyline and shared them on CNN iReport. The stunning sunsets were the result of raging wildfires in parts of Siberia. \"The dramatic sunsets began showing up over the weekend and had Seattle locals wondering where the amber-colored haze was originating from,\" Durken said. The fires were started in southeastern Siberia, by farmers burning grass in their fields. But on April 14, it is believed that the flames quickly grew out of control because of strong winds and spread throughout the region, according to CNN affiliate KOMO-TV. As a result, the fires have destroyed dozens of villages in the region. Rescue crews were able to put out the flames. However, the lingering smoke from the widespread fires were picked up by atmospheric winds. The winds carried the smoke from Siberia across the Pacific Ocean and brought it to the Pacific Northwest. Parts of Oregon, Washington and British Columbia are seeing the results of the smoke, wind and solar light combination. The reason people are seeing an intense red sunset is a result of smoke particles filtering out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight like greens, blues, yellows and purples, KOMO-TV said. That means colors like red and orange are able to penetrate the air unfiltered. The colors are especially intense during sunrises and sunsets because there is more atmosphere for the light to travel through to get to a person's eye. As the smoke starts to dissipate, air quality will get better and these fiery sunsets will lose their reddish hue.\n",

      "    Article: Twice French Open champion Serena Williams said her struggle to beat Sara Errani in the Fed Cup on Sunday had been a real 'eye-opener' as the claycourt season gets into full swing. World No 1 Williams eventually prevailed 4-6 7-6(3) 6-3 against the dogged Italian to take her career record over her to 8-0 but the American was not impressed. The US  were beaten 3-2 as Williams and Alison Riske were thrashed 6-0 6-3 in the doubles rubber by Errani and Flavia Pennetta, meaning they were relegated to World Group II. American tennis star Serena Williams fought back to beat Italian Sara Errani in the Fed Cup play-off on Sunday Tough weather conditions made it difficult for both players who had to keep on re-tossing their serves Errani gave Williams a real scare but in the end the world No 1's power proved to be too much 'Today has been a big eye opener,' Williams said afterwards. 'I'm totally not as ready for the claycourt season as I thought I was. Now I'm in the mindset of, \"You know what, I'm not on hard court.\" I'm playing like I'm on hard court and I'm not. 'So I have to play and be ready to hit a thousand shots if necessary.' Williams, 33, won her 19th singles grand slam at the Australian Open and her dominance has raised talk of her claiming all the majors this year. The French Open has been her least successful of the four though despite claiming the title in Paris in 2002 and 2013. Her doubles defeat on Sunday blotted an otherwise flawless Fed Cup record and left the US facing a battle to get back amongst the elite nations next year. 'We have to work harder,' US captain Mary Joe Fernandez said. 'We came close today and need to just keep plugging away. 'The good news is that we have a lot of players in the top 100 and, hopefully, we can get two wins next year and get back into the World Group.'

The app hires independent contractors who drive their own cars in a similar model to Uber taxis. Chipotle has gone from strength to strength in recent years and this month two presidential candidates have been spotted in their restaurants. Republican contender Marco Rubio is a regular in the outlets and recently told MailOnline that he always tips staff.

      "    Article: An FBI agent's sniper rifle (similar to the one pictured) was ripped out of his car's window and stolen from a Salt Lake City hotel parking lot An FBI agent's sniper rifle was  ripped out of his car's window and stolen from a Salt Lake City hotel parking lot just days before President Obama visited Utah earlier this month. The gun was inside a hard rifle case and was 'secured properly' to a truck safe with padlocks and chains while the car was parked at the Marriott Springhill Suites, according to police. Police believe the thief stole the rifle by breaking the rear right passenger-side window, tying a rope around the rifle case's handle or a cable lock, and using the momentum from another vehicle to then break the case's handle free from the lock. The window frame of the agent's car was pulled from the door, which police believe could indicate the large case was ripped through the shattered window. 'The rifle had been secured properly,' Salt Lake City Police Detective Dennis McGowan told Fox 13 Salt Lake City. 'There are all kinds of ways the weapon was secure. Yet someone was able to forcefully take the weapon.' The FBI agent also reported that his gear bag, backpack, and some clothing and tools were also stolen during the March 27 theft, which the police report states happened overnight. The theft happened just a week before Obama (pictured during his visit) made a scheduled trip to Utah earlier this month Officers found two skid marks and pieces of rope lying on the pavement near the car, as well as the broken-off handle of the rifle case. The agent's bags and some of his clothing were found at a Residence Inn across the street, but the sniper rifle has not been recovered. Marriott Springhill Suites, the agent's hotel, is next to the city's airport and just down the street from the state's FBI office. The hotel does not have surveillance cameras, according to the police report. Salt Lake City police said the rifle's serial number has been entered into the National Crime Information Computer. The Secret Service told Fox 13 Salt Lake City the agency was notified about the stolen rifle before President Obama's visit, but could not comment if the theft prompted an increase of security. Det. McGowan said police do not know if the thief specifically targeted the agent's car. The sniper rifle was stolen sometime overnight from the parking lot of Marriott Springhill Suites, where the agent was staying. The hotel is just across the street from the state's FBI office\n",

Former Brazil defender Ze Maria was fired on Wednesday after a poor run, only to be reinstated the next day after flamboyant owner Angelo Massone decided to 'give the coaching staff another chance.' But the 41-year-old former Inter Milan and Parma right back, capped 25 times by Brazil, angered Massone again after Ceahlaul were beaten 2-0 by mid-table FC Botosani on Saturday. Ze Maria represented Brazil on 25 occasions during an international career spanning five years The result left Ceahlaul 16th in the standings, six points adrift of safety. Ze Maria replaced Florin Marin in January to become Ceahlaul's third coach this season. He will be replaced by Serbian Vanya Radinovic.\n",

Mystery surrounds who had re-pointed the camera, but a spokesman for Birmingham City Council said they were aware of it. One of their engineers will now be visiting the site and the camera could be removed completely. 'Fixed location safety cameras have been decommissioned across the West Midlands since 2013 as the technology inside them had become obsolete,' the spokesman said. 'Plans for a pilot at a limited number of sites, using digital technology, is currently in development. 'Now the issue with this camera in Wellington Road has been brought to our attention, we will take any appropriate action at the site.' The spokesman confirmed that there were no plans to include the camera in Wellington Road in the new pilot. The owners of the house were not available for comment.\n",

Michael Barnett captured dramatic video of the fire, on Interstate 30 just northeast of Dallas, and uploaded it to CNN iReport. Smoke and flames poured from the rear of the bus as traffic slowed to a crawl and Barnett slowly approached in his vehicle. As he drew closer to the bus, Barnett decided to stop filming because he didn't know what to expect. \"It was shocking,\" he said. \"I didn't know what I was about to see. I didn't know if anyone was hurt.\" Barnett said he didn't realize at the time that the bus belonged to the country band. Hillary Scott, co-lead singer for the band, posted a photo of the charred bus on Instagram and noted that she, her husband, the tour manager and the driver were all evacuated safely. \"Thanking God for our safety and the safety of all of those who helped put this fire out and keep us safe,\" she wrote. The tour manager told CNN affiliate KTVT that the bus stopped after a rear tire blew out. It burst into flames after everyone had gotten off. Scott also posted an Instagram photo and message saying that the fire destroyed everything in the bus's back lounge except her Bible. The band's two other members, Charles Kelley and Dave Haywood, were not traveling on the bus, KTVT reported. Lady Antebellum is set to perform at the 50th Academy of Country Music Awards on Sunday in Arlington, Texas.\n",

      "    Article: (CNN)Lady Antebellum singer Hillary Scott's tour bus caught fire on a Texas freeway Thursday morning, but everyone on board was safely evacuated. Michael Barnett captured dramatic video of the fire, on Interstate 30 just northeast of Dallas, and uploaded it to CNN iReport. Smoke and flames poured from the rear of the bus as traffic slowed to a crawl and Barnett slowly approached in his vehicle. As he drew closer to the bus, Barnett decided to stop filming because he didn't know what to expect. \"It was shocking,\" he said. \"I didn't know what I was about to see. I didn't know if anyone was hurt.\" Barnett said he didn't realize at the time that the bus belonged to the country band. Hillary Scott, co-lead singer for the band, posted a photo of the charred bus on Instagram and noted that she, her husband, the tour manager and the driver were all evacuated safely. \"Thanking God for our safety and the safety of all of those who helped put this fire out and keep us safe,\" she wrote. The tour manager told CNN affiliate KTVT that the bus stopped after a rear tire blew out. It burst into flames after everyone had gotten off. Scott also posted an Instagram photo and message saying that the fire destroyed everything in the bus's back lounge except her Bible. The band's two other members, Charles Kelley and Dave Haywood, were not traveling on the bus, KTVT reported. Lady Antebellum is set to perform at the 50th Academy of Country Music Awards on Sunday in Arlington, Texas.\n",

      "    Article: The glowing blue letters that once lit the Bronx from above Yankee Stadium failed to find a buyer at an auction at Sotheby's on Wednesday. While the 13 letters were expected to bring in anywhere from $300,000 to $600,000, the only person who raised a paddle - for $260,000 - was a Sotheby's employee trying to jump start the bidding. The current owner of the signage is Yankee Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson, who purchased the 10-feet-tall letters for an undisclosed amount after the stadium saw its final game in 2008. No love: 13 letters that hung over Yankee Stadium were estimated to bring in anywhere from $300,000 to $600,000, but received no bids at a Sotheby's auction Wednesday The 68-year-old Yankee said he wanted 'a new generation to own and enjoy this icon of the Yankees and of New York City.' The letters had beamed from atop Yankee Stadium near Grand Concourse in the Bronx since 1976, the year before Jackson joined the team. ESPN reports Jackson, who attended the auction, bought the letters 'on a lark.' Jackson joked that once he saw the size of the letters, some of which are also 10-feet-wide, he realized he might have gotten ahead of himself. He promised before the auction that if the letters were bought by a bidder in the United States, he would fly out to see the signage himself at the winner's home. Yankee Stadium: The letters at the stadium, which was built in 1923, were installed in 1976 and taken down in 2008 In addition to the letters, Sotheby's was auctioning off a New York Mets bullpen car from the late 60s. Despite the Mets memorabilia being estimated at only $20,000 to $30,000, it raked in a winning bid of $112,500 at auction.\n",

The German star was in fine form as the World Cup winners beat Georgia 2-0 in their Euro 2016 qualifier on Sunday, and is now setting his sights on the Premier League encounter with Liverpool at the weekend. And Ozil gave an insight into what he does in his downtime after taking a snap of him playing with his pet with the caption: 'Home Sweet Home'. Mesut Ozil posted a picture on Twitter relaxing with his dog on Wednesday after returning home to London Ozil impressed on international duty as Germany beat Gerogia 2-0 in a Euro 2016 qualifier on Sunday The midfielder, who was signed for £42.5million from Real Madrid in 2013, missed Arsenal's last game against Newcastle through illness, but will be expected to start against Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium. Ozil was said to have been spotted in a Berlin nightclub after missing the Gunners' 2-1 win at St James' Park, though manager Arsene Wenger rubbished those claims. He has been doing the business on the pitch after returning from injury though,  wracking up four assists and scoring three goals since January. And the former Schalke man says he is finally adjusting to English football, claiming he fits in 'perfectly'. 'There are a lot of what we call 'English weeks' in Germany - where you play twice, and there's no winter break either,' he said. 'It's demanding because you don't have many breaks to recover, but as a footballer it's great to have so many games and I'm the sort of player who prefers playing in many matches - that's why I fit perfectly here.' The playmaker has been in fine form since returning from injury for Arsenal this year\n",

      "    Article: It's crunch time this weekend at the top of the Premier League as second-placed Arsenal host table toppers Chelsea - and it appears one star of the former's team cannot wait for the ever-nearing kick-off. Arsenal playmaker Mesut Ozil can now countdown the minutes until the 4pm encounter on Sunday with his brand new Apple Watch. The 26-year-old was the beneficiary of the timepiece - which ranges in price from £299 to £13,500 - as he visited an Apple store on Thursday afternoon. Arsenal midfielder Mesut Ozil (right) took to Instagram to show off his new Apple Watch on Thursday Ozil compared his watch to TV character Michael Knight in the hit action show Knight Rider Ozil took to Instagram to share his joy at his latest gift, comparing his gadget to former TV character Michael Knight from the hit action show Knight Rider. Accompanied with the caption: 'Excited about my new cool gadget! It's just like Michael Knight's watch, but a real one #knightrider #phone,' Ozil appears in awe of the device - which will be released on general sale on Friday. The midfielder, who has scored four goals in 25 matches for the Gunners in all competitions this season, is expected to start for Arsene Wenger's side at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday. Arsenal trail the Blues by 10 points with six league games remaining - but have been boosted by the return of Jack Wilshere. Wilshere was on the bench in their FA Cup semi-final win over Reading at Wembley on April 18 after five months out through injury. And club legend Ray Parlour believes that the 23-year-old’s fitness record is the one thing holding him back from reaching his undoubted potential in the Arsenal midfield. ‘I think he’s the future of the club,’ said Parlour. ‘I think if he stays fit, he’s a quality player, there’s no doubt about that. Jack Wilshere (centre) was on the bench for Arsenal's FA Cup semi-final against Reading Ray Parlour, who won three championships with Arsenal, has backed Wilshere to be the future of the club ‘The way he goes past players, the way he links up with people, I definitely think he’s got a big role to play. ‘But again, the big question mark is can he stay fit? Look at Abou Diaby. Diaby’s a terrific player. But look at him, the injuries the last few years. ‘The big burning question is can Wilshere have a full season without being injured for a long period, like he hasn’t had for the last three or four seasons.’ Wilshere, the England international, is pictured in training for Arsenal at London Colney last week\n",

The Japan international, who has played for the J-League side since 2013, will join Chelsea's Dutch partner club Vitesse Arnhem on loan next season if he completes a move to Stamford Bridge this summer. Ogane claims that Chelsea's interest in Muto is not connected to the £200million sponsorship deal they signed with Japanese company Yokohama Rubber in February. FC Tokyo forward Yoshinori Muto (centre) brings the ball forward against Albirex Niigata in March FC Tokyo president Naoki Ogane claims that Chelsea have made a bid for Japan international Muto Muto tussles with Yuji Nakazawa of Yokohama F.Marinos during a J-League clash last month Age: 22 Club: FC Tokyo Appearances: 37 Goals: 16 International caps (Japan): 11 International goals: 1 Did you know?

'It is a formal offer with conditions. They want to acquire him in the summer.' Muto, who only graduated from Keio University a fortnight ago after completing an economics degree, would be the first Japanese player to represent Chelsea if he moves to west London. He has earned 11 caps for his country after signing his first professional contract in 2014, scoring once for the Samurai Blue. A £4million deal for the youngster has been mooted, but Muto admits that he isn't sure if he will join the Premier League title chasers despite being pleased with their bid. He said: 'I have not decided yet at all. It is an honour for me to receive this offer from a great club.' Muto scored 13 times in his debut season with FC Tokyo and was named in the J-League's best XI. Muto admits it is an 'honour' to receive an offer from Chelsea although he has not yet decided to join the club Muto, pictured in action against Ventforet Kofu has scored three goals in four games so far this season The 22-year-old has a shot at goal during Japan's Asian Cup match against Palestine in January this year He has continued his fine form during the current campaign, helping his club to third place in the division with three goals in four games.

      "    Article: These extraordinary images show how an enormous jumbo jet has been converted into a luxury home for a mystery billionaire - complete with bedrooms, multiple lounges and an onboard restaurant. The custom-built Boeing 747 is believed to have cost its ultra-wealthy owner £400million after it was customised to fit his specifications exactly over a three-year period. The jumbo jet would normally carry as many as 600 passengers - but this version was built for just a single tycoon, although he will be able to fit dozens of guests. It contains a large dining room where travellers can enjoy meals cooked in an adjoining kitchen, with a lounge and 'state room' at the back of the plane. More sleeping space is provided in the 'aeroloft' on the top deck of the vessel, with eight full beds for passengers who prefer to get some shut-eye on flights. Luxury: This is the lounge on board a custom-built Boeing 747-8, as depicted in an artist's impression by Greenpoint Technologies Shuteye: The master bedroom of the £400million plane has a huge bed as well as an armchair and sofa for when the owner needs to relax Business: The conference room of the plane could be perfect for meetings in the sky with its long table in the centre Chill-out: The lounge decor looks like a luxury hotel, belying its true location inside a plane similar to those used by commercial airlines Executive: This room, which can be used as an office or a guest bedroom, gives a hint to its true location thanks to the porthole-style windows Kicking back: The main suite could easily be mistaken for a room in a top hotel thanks to its over-the-top decorations Restaurant: The central portion of the plane hosts a dining room which is attached to a kitchen, allowing the owner to make use of the services of a private chef Shiny: The jumbo jet is one of the most luxurious private planes ever built, with the price tag believed to have reached a total of £400million Sofa: Parts of the plane are set aside for guests to relax while watching television, as the vessel can carry several dozen passengers Plush: Another artist's impression of the main state room, which also contains a desk so the owner can switch between work and relaxation Welcoming: Images of the lounge show a space very different to the normal aeroplane cabin, with the traditional rows of seats completely discarded in favour of a hotel-like ambience Exclusive: Few people can ever imagine flying in this sort of luxury - far more glitzy than first class on commercial flights Plan: The layout of the Boeing 747 is shown in this plan published by Greenpoint Technologies Gigantic: The luxury interior has been built inside a Boeing 747-8 similar to this one, which can hold up to 600 passengers\n",

      "    Article: Nathan Hughes on Friday night had his ban for accidentally knocking out George North sensationally over-turned on appeal, following an outcry on his behalf. The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended for three matches, after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been ‘reckless’ for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion, as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27. Hughes was shown a red card for the offence, but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded. Although it was accepted that there had been no intent, the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing. Yet, in a stunning twist – and in light of fierce criticism – the ban was thrown out, as the appeal lodged by Wasps was up-held. Nathan Hughes's knee collided with George North's head as he crossed the line to score for Northampton North was left out cold on the pitch at Franklin's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher It was the third time that the Wales and Lions winger had been knocked out in the space of two months Fiji-born forward Hughes missed his side's Champions Cup quarter-final loss against Toulon last Sunday North was left unconscious by the clash; a third blow to the head in the space of two months. He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing, to counter-act his concussion symptoms. Graphic, slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin’s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes, but many more spoke up in his defence. Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended – and their dismay was shared by others outside the club. Captain James Haskell said: ‘Astounded would be an under-statement’, while fly-half Andy Goode added: ‘Really can’t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes. There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome.’ Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a ‘total joke’ and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment, calling it an ‘absolute joke’. Hughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27 Hughes missed his club’s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday, as he awaited his appeal hearing. He is now free to return to action immediately, but he is not in the match-day squad for Wasps’ Aviva Premiership trip to London Welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture, he is unlikely to play again until the visit of Exeter to Coventry on April 26. Jeremy Summers, chairman of the appeal hearing panel, said: ‘The appeal panel considered it appropriate to hear the matter afresh. Having done so and having had the advantage of evidence not before the original panel, it concluded that no act of foul play took place in that the incident occurred accidentally.’\n",

      "    Article: Steve Bruce is adamant he can keep Hull City in the Barclays Premier League after a 2-0 defeat by Southampton left them battling to stay up. At the start of the campaign Bruce was targeting 10 wins to survive, but despite a strong start his Hull side have mustered just six and he is hoping 'nine or eight might be enough.' Hull were the better side against Southampton for the first 45 minutes but a James Ward-Prowse penalty and late strike from Graziano Pelle meant they left with nothing. Steve Bruce is confident he can keep Hull City in the Premier League this season and avoid relegation They now have six games to save their season including nightmare fixtures against Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United. But Bruce insisted: 'Everyone is up for the challenge and I'm sure and convinced that we'll do it. If we keep remaining positive I'm convinced we can take a couple of results which will take us over the line. 'We've had a wonderful three years near enough from getting promoted to getting to a cup final, staying up last year. I've always had something in my water that this season would be the most difficult because all of a sudden you've created an expectation and unfortunately we haven't been able to live up to that expectation. Hull were beaten 2-0 by Southampton on Saturday and are just two points clear of the drop zone 'We've got our reasons for it, we've still got enough to keep us out of trouble I hope. We're bang in it but I'm still convinced we'll get out of it.' Bruce puts their struggles down to several long-term injuries to key players. At St Mary's Stadium, Mohamed Diame returned from five months out and James Chester from three. Michael Dawson and Nikica Jelavic have missed half the season and Robert Snodgrass has not been available at all. Bruce added: 'They are big players for us and unfortunately, at this moment, we haven't been able to cope. We've battled on manfully but not quite been good enough.' James Ward-Prowse slots home a penalty for Southampton against Hull as they moved up to fifth Ronald Koeman's side moved to fifth in the table ahead of Tottenham, who lost to Aston Villa, and Liverpool, who play Newcastle on Monday. But the Dutchman left with his own problems, after he had to intervene when Sadio Mane tried to take the penalty when Ward-Prowse was first-choice. Koeman will speak to his squad to remind them that team rules cannot be broken by anyone. Koeman said: 'I already had a word with Mane but we will talk to the team about that because maybe I have to mention it a bit more clearly.'\n",

      "    Article: An FBI agent's sniper rifle (similar to the one pictured) was ripped out of his car's window and stolen from a Salt Lake City hotel parking lot An FBI agent's sniper rifle was  ripped out of his car's window and stolen from a Salt Lake City hotel parking lot just days before President Obama visited Utah earlier this month. The gun was inside a hard rifle case and was 'secured properly' to a truck safe with padlocks and chains while the car was parked at the Marriott Springhill Suites, according to police. Police believe the thief stole the rifle by breaking the rear right passenger-side window, tying a rope around the rifle case's handle or a cable lock, and using the momentum from another vehicle to then break the case's handle free from the lock. The window frame of the agent's car was pulled from the door, which police believe could indicate the large case was ripped through the shattered window. 'The rifle had been secured properly,' Salt Lake City Police Detective Dennis McGowan told Fox 13 Salt Lake City. 'There are all kinds of ways the weapon was secure. Yet someone was able to forcefully take the weapon.' The FBI agent also reported that his gear bag, backpack, and some clothing and tools were also stolen during the March 27 theft, which the police report states happened overnight. The theft happened just a week before Obama (pictured during his visit) made a scheduled trip to Utah earlier this month Officers found two skid marks and pieces of rope lying on the pavement near the car, as well as the broken-off handle of the rifle case. The agent's bags and some of his clothing were found at a Residence Inn across the street, but the sniper rifle has not been recovered. Marriott Springhill Suites, the agent's hotel, is next to the city's airport and just down the street from the state's FBI office. The hotel does not have surveillance cameras, according to the police report. Salt Lake City police said the rifle's serial number has been entered into the National Crime Information Computer. The Secret Service told Fox 13 Salt Lake City the agency was notified about the stolen rifle before President Obama's visit, but could not comment if the theft prompted an increase of security. Det. McGowan said police do not know if the thief specifically targeted the agent's car. The sniper rifle was stolen sometime overnight from the parking lot of Marriott Springhill Suites, where the agent was staying. The hotel is just across the street from the state's FBI office\n",

Now A&E networks are remaking the miniseries, to air in 2016. A&E, Lifetime and History (formerly the History Channel) announced Thursday that the three networks would simulcast a remake of the saga of Kunta Kinte, an African who was captured, shipped to America and sold into slavery to work on a Virginia plantation. LeVar Burton, who portrayed Kinte in the original, will co-executive produce the new miniseries. A press release describes the new version as \"original\" and \"contemporary\" and will draw more from Alex Haley's classic novel, \"Roots: The Saga of an American Family.\" Producers will consult scholars in African and African-American history for added authenticity. \"We are proud to bring this saga to fans of the original, as well as to a new generation that will experience this powerful and poignant tale for the first time,\" said Dirk Hoogstra, History's executive vice president and general manager. \"Audiences will once again feel the impact of Kunta Kinte's indomitable spirit.\" Executive producer Mark Wolper, son of the original's producer David L. Wolper, added, \"Kunta Kinte began telling his story over 200 years ago and that story went through his family lineage, to Alex Haley, to my father, and now the mantle rests with me. Like Kunta Kinte fought to tell his story over and over again, so must we.\" The remade \"Roots\" will encounter a new generation of viewers who have witnessed Barack Obama make history as the nation's first African-American president and \"12 Years a Slave\" win the Oscar for Best Picture, but also widespread racial unrest over police treatment of black suspects in many U.S. cities. \"My career began with 'Roots' and I am proud to be a part of this new adaptation,\" said Burton. \"There is a huge audience of contemporary young Americans who do not know the story of 'Roots' or its importance.\"\n",

Ozil was said to have been spotted in a Berlin nightclub after missing the Gunners' 2-1 win at St James' Park, though manager Arsene Wenger rubbished those claims. He has been doing the business on the pitch after returning from injury though,  wracking up four assists and scoring three goals since January. And the former Schalke man says he is finally adjusting to English football, claiming he fits in 'perfectly'. 'There are a lot of what we call 'English weeks' in Germany - where you play twice, and there's no winter break either,' he said. 'It's demanding because you don't have many breaks to recover, but as a footballer it's great to have so many games and I'm the sort of player who prefers playing in many matches - that's why I fit perfectly here.'

      "    Article: (CNN)One of the biggest TV events of all time is being reimagined for new audiences. \"Roots,\" the epic miniseries about an African-American slave and his descendants, had a staggering audience of over 100 million viewers back in 1977. Now A&E networks are remaking the miniseries, to air in 2016. A&E, Lifetime and History (formerly the History Channel) announced Thursday that the three networks would simulcast a remake of the saga of Kunta Kinte, an African who was captured, shipped to America and sold into slavery to work on a Virginia plantation. LeVar Burton, who portrayed Kinte in the original, will co-executive produce the new miniseries. A press release describes the new version as \"original\" and \"contemporary\" and will draw more from Alex Haley's classic novel, \"Roots: The Saga of an American Family.\" Producers will consult scholars in African and African-American history for added authenticity. \"We are proud to bring this saga to fans of the original, as well as to a new generation that will experience this powerful and poignant tale for the first time,\" said Dirk Hoogstra, History's executive vice president and general manager. \"Audiences will once again feel the impact of Kunta Kinte's indomitable spirit.\" Executive producer Mark Wolper, son of the original's producer David L. Wolper, added, \"Kunta Kinte began telling his story over 200 years ago and that story went through his family lineage, to Alex Haley, to my father, and now the mantle rests with me. Like Kunta Kinte fought to tell his story over and over again, so must we.\" The remade \"Roots\" will encounter a new generation of viewers who have witnessed Barack Obama make history as the nation's first African-American president and \"12 Years a Slave\" win the Oscar for Best Picture, but also widespread racial unrest over police treatment of black suspects in many U.S. cities. \"My career began with 'Roots' and I am proud to be a part of this new adaptation,\" said Burton. \"There is a huge audience of contemporary young Americans who do not know the story of 'Roots' or its importance.\"\n",

Scroll down for video Challenging: Dayna Dobias, 18, is hoping change the way people with disabilities are represented by the television, film and the fashion industry Her hope is that the video not only entertains, but inspires others to think before judging. The teenager says her motivation for creating the video was to counteract stereotypes held by people over certain disabilities. 'People tend to think that because I have cerebral palsy I cannot do anything and that I am so different from everyone else, when in reality I am pretty much just the same as everyone else,' she added. 'I might do things a little bit differently than most people, but that doesn't mean that I should be treated differently.' This is one of several videos that Dayna has created.

Dayna says she wanted to turn any negativity that might be held over her disability into something positive and hopefully inspire others, or at the very least raise a smile. 'When I was first diagnosed with cerebral palsy, doctors warned my parents that I may never walk, but here I am dancing! I drive, I go to college, I do things like every other 19-year-old,' she says.

Henderson and Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet both played their 47th game of season in the 2-0 win over Newcastle United on Monday night, equalling the record for appearances by any player in the top five European leagues so far this campaign. But the England midfielder believes that after finding winning form again following poor results against Manchester United and Arsenal, Liverpool can pile the pressure on to City who sit four points above them in the race for the Champions League. Liverpool vice-captain Jordan Henderson thinks his side could catch Manchester City in the  Premier League Henderson played his 47th game of season in the 2-0 win over Newcastle United on Monday night Manchester City have been faltering and lost 4-2 at Manchester United, Liverpool are four points behind 'We knew it was an important game for us,' Henderson said 'Obviously the last couple of weeks in the Premier League have been disappointing both with performances and results. We knew today we needed to put that right and I think we did that with a great result for us. 'We've got ground to make up but we'll just keep going, keep winning in games and putting in performances. Come the end of the season, you never know.' Raheem Sterling pulled off some fine skill to open the scoring in the ninth minute at Anfield before Joe Allen capitalised on a defensive mistake to score his first Anfield goal with 20 minutes to go.

'It wasn't my best game but I got the goal and helped the team. It was important after the defeats.' Newcastle had what looked a strong shout for a penalty when Dejan Lovren appeared to foul Ayoze Perez in the area, and Allen admitted he thought it was a spot-kick. 'I did get a good view of it as I'd missed the ball in the build-up,' he said. 'It look a good shout for a penalty, but I didn't get one the other night. These things happen.'

      "    Article: (CNN)SpaceX on Tuesday launched a two-stage Falcon 9 rocket carrying an uncrewed cargo spacecraft called Dragon on a flight from Cape Canaveral, Florida, to the International Space Station. That was the easy part. In a difficult bid to land a rocket stage on a floating barge for the first time, the private space exploration company  was unsuccessful. SpaceX founder Elon Musk tweeted: \"Ascent successful. Dragon enroute to Space Station. Rocket landed on droneship, but too hard for survival.\" He later clarified that the rocket landed, but tipped over. SpaceX tried to land a Falcon 9 on the drone ship in January, but the rocket hit at an angle and exploded. SpaceX has said it will keep trying and, after it masters landing at sea, hopes to someday land rockets on the ground. Usually booster rockets burn up in Earth's atmosphere or, like NASA's space shuttle boosters, they fall back into the ocean. So why try to land one? Musk wants to cut costs. On his company's website, he says that if anyone can figure out how to \"reuse rockets just like airplanes, the cost of access to space will be reduced by as much as a factor of a hundred.\" What about the rest of the rocket and the Dragon? The smaller, top part of the rocket will carry the Dragon into orbit and then break away from the cargo ship and burn up in Earth's atmosphere. The Dragon will dock with the space station a couple of days after launch to deliver more than 4,300 pounds (1,950 kilograms) of supplies, including research equipment and ISSpresso, an espresso maker that astronauts can use to make coffee and tea. The space station crew will spend about five weeks unpacking the Dragon. They'll then stuff it with over 3,000 pounds of science experiments, trash and other stuff to send back to Earth. When they're done, Dragon will leave the space station and mission controllers will guide it to splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off California. This is the sixth SpaceX mission to the International Space Station. The company was the first private space contractor to dock with the station. Tuesday's launch was the second attempt for this mission. Monday's planned launch was scrubbed due to weather. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.\n",

      "    Article: Jamie Carragher believes Brendan Rodgers is still the right man to lead Liverpool forward after a season with no trophies and a likely finish outside the top four. Rodgers' future at Anfield has been questioned after a third straight season without a trophy, but the former Liverpool defender backed the Reds manager. Speaking after collecting a Beacon Award for his community work on Merseyside on Tuesday, Carragher said: 'I don't think your whole future should be determined by one game. Jamie Carragher shared this image on Instagram after collecting a Beacon Award on Tuesday 'It was difficult with the players that came in and I still don't think many of them have bedded in yet.' Liverpool are seven points behind fourth placed Manchester City with a game in hand and look set to miss out on Champions League qualification for next season. Carragher added: 'Brendan, the players and the staff will be looking to next season and thinking they will go one step further, winning a trophy maybe and getting back into the top four. 'That's his job. He has to identify where in the team they need to improve; the squad is there and they did a lot of that last summer. Brendan Rodgers is under pressure at Liverpool after a third straight season without a trophy Liverpool were knocked out of the FA Cup by Aston Villa in a disappointing semi-final performance 'The signings have to be right, and if they are it will make a massive difference. If they're not they'll be back to where they are this season.' Carragher received a Beacon Award at a ceremony in London on Tuesday night for his community work on Merseyside. The 37-year-old, who played 737 games for Liverpool, has provided coaching in eight schools in deprived areas of Merseyside through his 23 Foundation. Carragher, pictured at the 26th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, backed Rodgers to stay at Anfield The former Liverpool defender added: 'I hope that I can give youngsters a lift and that extra push to realise their goals. Liverpool is a place that likes to see its own do well. It is a tight-knit community and growing up I got a lot of help and encouragement from people around me. 'I'm from an under-privileged area – Bootle in Liverpool. If I ever got the chance to help that area and the wider community I've always felt I would. 'There are plenty of philanthropists around the world who do great work and I am one of the many trying to do my little bit that will hopefully help people in my area.'\n",

      "    Article: Four-year-old James Hayward had his toy gun confiscated at East Midlands Airport A four-year-old boy was frisked by airport security and then forced to hand over his plastic nerf gun after it was deemed a security risk. James Hayward had arrived at East Midlands Airport with his parents, Phil, 44, and Hazel, 38, with his brightly coloured toy - which fires sponge darts - packed in his hand luggage for their flight out to Lanzarote. But  security officers, who were described as 'over-zealous' by the boy's father, then took exception to James's harmless toy when it was picked up on the system's X-ray machines. They demanded he hand it over, and they also performed a thorough patting down and inspection of the primary school child. Dad Phil has labelled the security checks 'ludicrous' and criticized how staff reacted in the situation. Mr Hayward, a software engineer, said: 'Fair enough they are thorough but it just seemed a bit ludicrous to take a plastic gun away from a four-year-old. 'We were so late by this point I didn't have time to stop and argue with them so we just had to leave it because we didn't want to miss our flight. 'I explained to James we would get him a new one when we got back from our holiday. We were going for 10 days in Lanzarote over Easter. 'I thought it was a bit over-zealous of the security staff considering how many people were trying to get through at the time. 'No wonder it was taking so long if they wanted to pat down every little kid. Scroll down for video After returning from the holiday to Lanzarote, the four-year-old boy was bought a replacement toy gun The smile is back on James Hayward's face following the confiscation of his toy gun at East Midlands Airport The £6 plastic gadget was described as a semi-automatic soft dart gun by its manufacturers, and James was bought a new one off eBay when the family returned from their holidays. East Midlands Airport apologised for the inconvenience but pointed out they had offered to post the toy back to the family's home in Doncaster, South Yorkshire. Defending the decision a spokeswoman said: 'The safety and security of our passengers is our first priority and all regulations on security are set by the government. 'This regulation states that no items may be permitted through security that resemble a prohibited item.' The hand luggage restrictions on all UK flights is set by the Department of Transport, and while there is no specific mention of models and makes of such 'toy guns,' the prohibited list does include 'replica or model guns.' East Midlands Airport said that 'no items may be permitted through security that resemble a prohibited item'\n",

The Iowa Board of Chiropractic released a report Wednesday detailing charges against Charles Manuel, of Lamoni. Manuel signed an agreement last month admitting his misdeeds and pledging not to apply for reinstatement for at least 10 years. Patient satisfaction: A chiropractor in Iowa has surrendered his license to practice and admitted to swapping services for sex and performing exorcisms on some patients. Nonetheless, he's received outstanding evaluations for patient satisfaction on HealthGrades.com The agreement requires that Manuel prove any circumstances surrounding the revocation of his license no longer exist before he can resume practicing chiropractic in the state. Those circumstances included bartering sex for services with some patients. Manuel also recommended that patients stop taking medication he prescribed to them. A woman who answered a call to Manuel's home from the Des Moines Register declined to comment on the case. A woman at his former practice said he hadn't worked there for some time. A Lamoni address listed on the Yelp page for Manuel's practice appears to be a home on a residential street. While Maneul has received just three patient survey responses on HealthGrades.com, those responses were quite positive. The disgraced chiropractor received a perfect five out of five stars in patient satisfaction. Strange practice: Charles Manuel, who admitted wrongdoing to the Iowa Board of Chiropractic, listed his practice's addresses on this residential street in the small agricultural town of Lamoni in southern Iowa\n",

Dayna Dobias, 19, from Downers Grove was born with cerebral palsy, but she hopes to inspire others with her enthusiastic videos. 'I've gotten bullied because of it and I get people all the time, staring and so it's definitely made things difficult in my life,' Dayna told Daily Mail Online. Scroll down for video Challenging: Dayna Dobias, 18, is hoping change the way people with disabilities are represented by the television, film and the fashion industry Her hope is that the video not only entertains, but inspires others to think before judging. The teenager says her motivation for creating the video was to counteract stereotypes held by people over certain disabilities. 'People tend to think that because I have cerebral palsy I cannot do anything and that I am so different from everyone else, when in reality I am pretty much just the same as everyone else,' she added. 'I might do things a little bit differently than most people, but that doesn't mean that I should be treated differently.' This is one of several videos that Dayna has created. Last year the teenager produced another dancing clip with her strutting her stuff to Taylor Swift's Shake It Off. Inspirational: The Illinois teen who suffers from cerebal palsy has created a video in which she dances Don't judge: People tend to think that because I have cerebral palsy I cannot do anything and that I am so different from everyone else, when in reality I am pretty much just the same as everyone else,' Dayna says 'People like to define me based on disability. People just look at me and think, oh that's just the girl with cerebral palsy,' she said. 'I would like people to look past that and be like, oh she's just one of us.' Dayna says she wanted to turn any negativity that might be held over her disability into something positive and hopefully inspire others, or at the very least raise a smile. 'When I was first diagnosed with cerebral palsy, doctors warned my parents that I may never walk, but here I am dancing! I drive, I go to college, I do things like every other 19-year-old,' she says. The teen has now begun to do some motivational speaking at a couple of local schools. Confident: Dayna has now taken up motivational speaking and has visited several schools in the Chicago area\n",

      "    Article: An FBI agent's sniper rifle (similar to the one pictured) was ripped out of his car's window and stolen from a Salt Lake City hotel parking lot An FBI agent's sniper rifle was  ripped out of his car's window and stolen from a Salt Lake City hotel parking lot just days before President Obama visited Utah earlier this month. The gun was inside a hard rifle case and was 'secured properly' to a truck safe with padlocks and chains while the car was parked at the Marriott Springhill Suites, according to police. Police believe the thief stole the rifle by breaking the rear right passenger-side window, tying a rope around the rifle case's handle or a cable lock, and using the momentum from another vehicle to then break the case's handle free from the lock. The window frame of the agent's car was pulled from the door, which police believe could indicate the large case was ripped through the shattered window. 'The rifle had been secured properly,' Salt Lake City Police Detective Dennis McGowan told Fox 13 Salt Lake City. 'There are all kinds of ways the weapon was secure. Yet someone was able to forcefully take the weapon.' The FBI agent also reported that his gear bag, backpack, and some clothing and tools were also stolen during the March 27 theft, which the police report states happened overnight. The theft happened just a week before Obama (pictured during his visit) made a scheduled trip to Utah earlier this month Officers found two skid marks and pieces of rope lying on the pavement near the car, as well as the broken-off handle of the rifle case. The agent's bags and some of his clothing were found at a Residence Inn across the street, but the sniper rifle has not been recovered. Marriott Springhill Suites, the agent's hotel, is next to the city's airport and just down the street from the state's FBI office. The hotel does not have surveillance cameras, according to the police report. Salt Lake City police said the rifle's serial number has been entered into the National Crime Information Computer. The Secret Service told Fox 13 Salt Lake City the agency was notified about the stolen rifle before President Obama's visit, but could not comment if the theft prompted an increase of security. Det. McGowan said police do not know if the thief specifically targeted the agent's car. The sniper rifle was stolen sometime overnight from the parking lot of Marriott Springhill Suites, where the agent was staying. The hotel is just across the street from the state's FBI office\n",

A man in a 'distinctive' cartoon mask demanded cash from owner's daughter on Saturday Police were reportedly called to the Union St dairy, in east Christchurch at about 12.30pm, after receiving reports of a masked man demanding cash from the dairy owner's daughter. Christina Chen told reporters her 30-year-old daughter ran out of the shop screaming 'robber!'. The masked man threw the cash register to the ground and took off with the till drawer and up to $1,500. 'Normally they just rob cigarettes and some more things, it's not a big issue,' Chen told Stuff.co.nz. 'But this time they were scary because they wore a mask, and we don't know who it is.' Police say there were no signs of any weapons used but that the robber remained at large.

'I was proud of my first cap, I was proud to represent the Under 21s, and 50 caps at my age is good,' added Hart. 'I want to keep going, that’s not the end for me. I just want to keep going, keep playing well for my club and country and rack them up.' England ace Hart, pictured saving a shot by Citadin Eder, is desperate to add to his 50 international caps\n",

      "    Article: These extraordinary images show how an enormous jumbo jet has been converted into a luxury home for a mystery billionaire - complete with bedrooms, multiple lounges and an onboard restaurant. The custom-built Boeing 747 is believed to have cost its ultra-wealthy owner £400million after it was customised to fit his specifications exactly over a three-year period. The jumbo jet would normally carry as many as 600 passengers - but this version was built for just a single tycoon, although he will be able to fit dozens of guests. It contains a large dining room where travellers can enjoy meals cooked in an adjoining kitchen, with a lounge and 'state room' at the back of the plane. More sleeping space is provided in the 'aeroloft' on the top deck of the vessel, with eight full beds for passengers who prefer to get some shut-eye on flights. Luxury: This is the lounge on board a custom-built Boeing 747-8, as depicted in an artist's impression by Greenpoint Technologies Shuteye: The master bedroom of the £400million plane has a huge bed as well as an armchair and sofa for when the owner needs to relax Business: The conference room of the plane could be perfect for meetings in the sky with its long table in the centre Chill-out: The lounge decor looks like a luxury hotel, belying its true location inside a plane similar to those used by commercial airlines Executive: This room, which can be used as an office or a guest bedroom, gives a hint to its true location thanks to the porthole-style windows Kicking back: The main suite could easily be mistaken for a room in a top hotel thanks to its over-the-top decorations Restaurant: The central portion of the plane hosts a dining room which is attached to a kitchen, allowing the owner to make use of the services of a private chef Shiny: The jumbo jet is one of the most luxurious private planes ever built, with the price tag believed to have reached a total of £400million Sofa: Parts of the plane are set aside for guests to relax while watching television, as the vessel can carry several dozen passengers Plush: Another artist's impression of the main state room, which also contains a desk so the owner can switch between work and relaxation Welcoming: Images of the lounge show a space very different to the normal aeroplane cabin, with the traditional rows of seats completely discarded in favour of a hotel-like ambience Exclusive: Few people can ever imagine flying in this sort of luxury - far more glitzy than first class on commercial flights Plan: The layout of the Boeing 747 is shown in this plan published by Greenpoint Technologies Gigantic: The luxury interior has been built inside a Boeing 747-8 similar to this one, which can hold up to 600 passengers\n",
